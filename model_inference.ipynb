       "['I absolutely L-O-V-E this oil. I have acne prone skin in my 30’s, and use this on top of my evening cream as a final moisture lock-in. Its smell is a spa-grade aromatherapy treatment that instantly relaxes me. I’ve had facial oil in my routine, previously Drunk Elephant, for years and swear by its wrinkle prevention qualities. Oily/acne prone skin can become dry out from the acids/treatments we use, and it’s important to put the moisture back in after its taken off to prevent skin from over-compensating throughout the day. The formula in Lotus does just that while keeping breakouts and pesky wrinkles away. The scent of this oil won me over and I look forward to it every evening as a final pampering. It doesn’t break me out, my skin glows after application, and one bottle lasts me at least 6 months. Just a few drops is all you need to cover the face, neck and décolleté.  If you’re on the fence, treat yourself and do it!',\n",
       " 'I gave this 3 stars because it give me tiny little white heads from first use ima give it few more days before making a final decision on keeping or returning it, all thought it did keep my oily face under control and I was not as oily but it feels though as it trapped the oil in my pores?!',\n",
       " 'Works well as soon as I wash my face and pat dry it. Smells amazing too.',\n",
       " 'this oil helped with hydration and breakouts, I love this!!',\n",
       " 'This is my first product review ever so that should tell you how much I love this. I actually bought this in my low 20s but I was drinking, eating terrible foods, and using strong/aggressive products in college so one oil can only do so much. Years later, I now understand I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and have a great skincare routine. I decided to give this a try again and oh my gosh my maskne disappeared. I’m not even joking I’ve been using this product for a month and I haven’t had one pimple. For me my acne comes from closed comedones becoming inflamed and thus turning into pimples but since using this it just becomes a blackhead that easily comes out. No mask cysts! And when I do extract my blackheads I rub this oil afterwards and the next day my skin is back to normal, when usually I would have red/aggravated skin for a couple of days. Please try this out if you have to wear a mask for the entire day due to work and you have maskne!',\n",
       " 'I have  been using this for 5  years now and I have no complaints. It keeps my hormonal skin glowing and blemish free! Highly recommend if you have normal skin that occasionally  reacts to hormonal changes . I only use when needed- so 1 bottle lasts months!',\n",
       " 'I first used the Lotus oil in 2014 or so, however, during a move it unfortunately broke (blame my careless ex-bf then) and I was also broke and never bought a new one to replace it.  Fast-forward to me being financially stable and remembering how much of a gem this Clarins item was... I FINALLY re-ordered again.  Haha.  The scent isn’t exactly as I remembered, but definitely not bothersome.  I will continue to use with hope my glow from this product will return xo',\n",
       " 'Super short back story- when I was in my teens, my mother worked for Clarins and of course got all kinds of stuff deeply discounted. In my 20s she no longer worked there and I realized that I could not afford all of the Clarins stuff I had been buying with her discount and had to pick and choose. Back then the Lotus Oil was the only thing I continued to buy at full price. Over a decade later, I’m still buying the Lotus Oil. I have combination acne prone skin. The Lotus Oil feels so good- heavy but in a nice way. It keeps my break outs to a minimum and makes my face feel smooth and hydrated. I love this stuff and will always re-purchase!',\n",
       " 'first oil that I’ve tried and I really like it. I was hesitant about using an oil due to sensitive skin but I decided to give it a try since there were good ratings.',\n",
       " 'This is the best treatment oil I’ve ever had! It’s not greasy and it has very light texture. It can be mixed with moisturizer or wear it alone, either way it feels comfortable and light on the skin. After weeks, my pores are smaller than before.',\n",
       " 'Heard of this oil from an influencer and it is heavenly. This is the last step of my night skin care. I either use BeautyBio GloPro before this oil or some nights I’ll put the oil then do guasha. In the morning I wake up and my skin is brighter and smooth. It’s a little pricey but it works and a little goes a long way.',\n",
       " 'One of the best facial oils I’ve ever tried! It nourishes well, is easy to apply, does not clog pores, gets absorbed quickly without leaving skin oily. I use it only 3 times a week, and always warm it up in my hands before applying to my face. It’s also great for facial massage! I feel like over time it really balances the skin and helps to even out the tone.',\n",
       " 'holy oil and here it is ,the one and only ,always !',\n",
       " 'This really works!!! You have to use it for at least a week but even after one night I could tell the difference.  It’s all natural and doesn’t over dry your face either .',\n",
       " 'I used to wake up with my face oily, but after finding this I sometimes mix it my moisturizer a little or apply after my skincare routine and it has helped! it also smells great!',\n",
       " 'I don’t recall if I purchased Lotus Face Treatment at Sephora or elsewhere but I literally keep it in the back of my medicine cabinet, ignored, for what might be years at a time. Every once in awhile my nose skin texture changes - pores spread open, tiny pimples appear or something - and I remember I have it. Last night I had such a nose and  applied this wonder oil. I awoke to smaller pores - nearly closed - and smoother skin. A couple more nights and I’m sure I’ll have a presentable nose again. Of course I will repurchase if I ever get to the bottom of the bottle. Somehow this oil relieves irritation and, unbelievably, helps pores shrink back their smallest. Over extended use it balances the production of oil where it is regularly applied. I put it on after my other serums or alone and it works both ways.',\n",
       " 'I love this oil! The smell is amazing, it relaxes me each night. I have HUGE pores, this hasnt cured them but they’ve been noticeably smaller since using this oil. It also surprisingly helps my acne and older acne scars.',\n",
       " 'I use this as my bedtime ritual.  In the morning my face feels hydrated and looks so smooth and soft.  I don’t find it soaked up on my pillowcase.',\n",
       " 'It works well as a moisturizing oil, but it didn’t improve my skin’s texture any. The scent is just okay— very earthy. I will use it up but not buy again',\n",
       " 'Clarins is just....simply amazing!!! What combo skin doesn’t want balanced oil production and tighter pores it’s a win/win LOVE THIS STUFF!!!',\n",
       " 'Never thought you need to use oil for an oily skin! This one has amazing smell and absorbs pretty fast. I put a small amount on my face and felt instant hydration! Must have in winter time. Love it !',\n",
       " 'I love this product. It is perfect for all skin types and it does not leave your face feeling oily after using it. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.',\n",
       " 'Controls shine and balances the skin! Holy grail skin care product. Has completely replaced my night time moisturizer. I have oily combination skin with slight rosacea and this has revolutionized my skin. I have noticed an improvement in the overall tone and feel of my skin. I highly recommend this product and Clarins in general. None of their products irritate my sensitive skin and never break me out',\n",
       " 'This made my white heads disappear overnight.',\n",
       " 'LOVE this product, the bottle lasts a long time and I use twice a day.   My 39 years young skin has never looked better.  Wears well under makeup too',\n",
       " 'I used to have produce enough oil to moisturize my whole body after a full day. UNTIL i started using this product. I was super skeptical when the Sephora rep told me about it when i asked about face lotions to control oil. I mean, oil to control oil?! But it totally made sense that if your face already has oil, it won’t fell the need to produce more! I gave it a try and it’s WONDERFUL. A little goes a long way, it smells FANTASTIC, and my face is not an oily mess at the end of the day. For me, it’s well worth the money! Give it a try!!',\n",
       " 'I’m so in love with this product!!! I have oily skin and I’m sometimes prone to acne. This actually cleared my skin and I can’t imagine using anything else now. I pair it with the Clarind Iris tonic. I wash my face, put on the tonic,  place about a dime size amount in the palm of my hand, press my hand together a few times, then press the product onto my face and neck . I LOVE LOVE LOVE this. It has actually helped control my oil and leaves my skin feeling confortable and balanced. Price is literally the only bad thing about this product (we all understand) -just buy it.',\n",
       " 'I have combination skin and have struggled with acne brake outs since my teens, I have always just reverted to products with harsh chemicals',\n",
       " 'I would wake up looking like someone poured oil all over my face. I’ve been using this for a month at night and I wake up with a soft skin with minimal oil. My did spouse mentioned I smell like lemon furniture polish which doesn’t bother me. Plus it fades away and I like the scent.',\n",
       " 'Love this oil! Works well mixed with a moisturizer to add additional hydration during the dryer months. I also love the smell, but it doesn’t linger if you are sensitive to scents.',\n",
       " 'I have a very littke sample of this product. Im not sure but I think it is going to help my skin to improve. I recently have had many blemishes, red scars of break outs, and also dryness!!! because of season change, but since I have been using this even though it it is a really small sample, I have seen many improvements for both problems.',\n",
       " 'I’m in my 30’s and have combination skin. I never leave reviews, but this treatment oil has been more effective for my adult acne than any other product I’ve ever tried. Not only that, but it leaves my skin balanced and doesn’t dry it out. My anxiety over acne has been replaced with anxiety over this product ever being discontinued. It’s been a life changer for me. Absolutely love it and could not recommend it enough!',\n",
       " 'Great for using both under your usual moisturizer and on its own. It’s not too greasy and smells heavenly.',\n",
       " 'I have Oily skin, mainly in my t-zone. used this once, at bed time, woke up with a chin full off white heads :( smells nice, great texture however, I don’t think I’ll be using the rest of my sample.',\n",
       " 'I really enjoy this oil. I have been using it on my chin where I tend to get hormonal break outs/ under the skin pimples and this has visibly reduced that. there was a time where every month I was getting one of those giant under the skin pimples and it would stick around for days no matter what I did. Since I started using them the normal acne under the skin pimple has barely appeared and it only lasted for 1 day.',\n",
       " 'This is a great product. My skin always looks amazing after I use it. Don’t use  this if you have a oily skin.',\n",
       " 'I have Acne-prone & sensitive combination skin and this is my most trusted favorite! I’ve tried so many different face oils but this one just works with in all the right ways and it smells so good!',\n",
       " 'This product was used on my skin when I had a facial at Pro Sports Club in Bellvue, Washington. I asked what she was using and she told me. I purchased a bottle from them along with a Booster Detox. I was told how to use the Lotus oil and the Detox. I was concerned about the oily appearance of the Lotus oil, but after I gave it a try, it is amazing. My acne prone skin is getting better and it is not as oily in the T-Zone area. Yes, I still have adult acne at the age of 63. Have been dealing with dermatologists for years without any long term results.. My skin is soft and supple now. I still use my moisturizer on top of the application of lotus oil. I wait about five minutes or so before applying the moisturizer. I was told to use the Booster Detox only once a week with the oil. I have not used the Booster Detox yet, and my skin is still responding to the Lotus oil. Great Product, and I have tried everything. This works well on my acne prone skin!! Keep it away from your eye area; it is not for the eyes. I was also told to only use two ( 2 ) drops and do not rub it in; pat it on the skin instead. That is enough.. You will have a tendency to want to use more and rub, but the 2 drops is enough and pat in on... It’s there and working.',\n",
       " 'This is the first time I felt the need to review something. I bought this because a cast mate at Sephora recommended it and it had great reviews but after using it for a while I found it didn’t work well on my acne prone skin which is says its supposed to. I had breakouts on my cheeks and after I did some research on ouls and acne prone skin I decided to stop using it. My skin is clearing up now which I can attribute to not using this product. i wish it worked because I love the smell.',\n",
       " 'I’ve tried absolutely every moisturizer and oil that Sephora offers and nothing makes my face feel and look the way this oil does! I am combination skin, oily tzone, acne prone, and always in the sun daily! However, my face looks really good, clear and glowing since using this oil. Give it a try!',\n",
       " 'this product is amazing, I have struggled with acne for many years, I’ve tried tons of things to help and nothing ever worked like this has in just a few weeks! I bought Sunday Riley UFO and went through a whole bottle, I enjoyed it so I was planning on purchasing another, when I went in store I saw this oil and read some reviews, I decided to try this one and it has been amazing! This oil is 99x better than UFO, my skin has cleared up so much! I only have 2 breakouts on my face right now, I can’t even remember the last time my face looked like this. The moment I knew I would never be without this was when I was getting a huuuuge cyst under my skin, it was hurting, it was red and I could feel it about to start getting bigger and bigger, this was last Sunday 06/11/17. I have gotten that type of cyst before and it always takes forever for it to go away and be flat again, I used the oil morning and night and by Wednesday it was completely flat, I was shooooook! Completely obsessed with this.',\n",
       " 'I have big pores and a lot of oil, and tried Sunday Riley U.F.O. which didn’t really do much for me. This stuff, however, is a dang miracle. It’s made my skin less oily, and much more glowy. This is going to be a lifelong product for me.',\n",
       " 'My absolute product from Clarins! I have enlarged pores on my nose and cheeks, and using this product definitely helps minimize their appearance. Because I’m especially oily all over, I use this 2-3 drops of this products only at night as the last step in my skincare routine and I wake up with smooth, hydrated skin.\\r\\r*Also be sure to store this in a cool, dark area like in your medicine cabinet. Too much exposure to direct sunlight or artificial lighting can turn the color of the oil white. I don’t know if the color necessarily affects its efficacy, but since it carries such a hefty price tag I don’t wanna take my chances!',\n",
       " 'I have very oily T zone and suffer from adult acne break out every month. This oil worked wonders for me in reducing black heads and acne break outs.  It did cause some redness in the first week and I am so glad I didn’t give up.  Major improvements in my skin condition became evident after one month of twice a day usage.  My nose still gets oily and requires blotting through the day but the reduction in acne breakout (both in frequency and severity) is worth the price.  How I wish I had purchased this sooner, like years sooner!',\n",
       " 'I originally received this oil as a sample when I went into a Clarins store in Paris last April. Regrettably, I’ve kept it in the back of my medicine cabinet until just recently when my skin went insane for like 10th time this year. I have struggled with “bipolar“ acne since I was 13 and I have tried everything imaginable, from clinique, to proactive, two types of birth control, and antibiotics. I also have mild scarring, and since I’ve started using this my acne has completely vanished. No joke. So as soon as I ran out of the sample I did not hesitate to buy the full size. I have seriously never had anything work so well on my skin. I put a generous amount on every night and even that isn’t very much, it’ll definitely last a while. It also smells amazing which is just a bonus considering how well it works',\n",
       " 'I have oily skin and have to be very careful what products I use so I don’t break out. I discovered Lotus Oil 3 years ago and it’s the one product I just can’t live without! It even helps clear up breakouts and gives your skin a nice glow the next morning when you wake up. I have noticed it helps with fine lines as well! I would give this product 10 stars if I could!',\n",
       " 'Using this oil has miraculously improved my complexion. I have soft, minimal pores and a youthful glow!',\n",
       " 'This Clarin’s oil was recommended by a friend. I use it at night after washing my face. It stops breakout and absorbs quickly. I have noticed a noticeable difference in my skin.Smells nice and I’ve recommended it to friend. I’ve also have repurchased several times.',\n",
       " 'So, I can see this being the sort of oil that won’t work for everyone. I highly recommend trying to get a sample of it first because it works quickly if it’s going to work for you. My esthetician gave me my sample on the way out of an appointment as something fun to try and I was shocked to find that it cleared up acne I’d been fighting for two years. I changed nothing else in my diet or skincare regimen and the results were pretty immediate. I just bought a full size bottle from Sephora and continue to love this product. It did dry my skin a bit but I’ll take needing extra lotion over acne any day. I highly recommend!',\n",
       " 'This product has been a lifesaver in the dry winter months. My skin is incredibly oily already so when a coworker recommended I give the Lotus Oil a try, I was incredibly skeptical. However, one sample and I was hooked. My skin is very prone to acne and is very sensitive, but this oil has toned down the acne-caused redness. Additionally, it also calms down any breakouts I get. It doesn’t erradicate them, but it does prevent them and calm them down a little. Overall, this oil is amazing for long-term moisturizing and skin improvement. I only wish it wouldn’t be so pricy! But only using 4 drops at night, it lasts awhile.',\n",
       " 'I walked into Sephora the day after damaging my skin trying to pop blackheads out because I needed to restock on moisturizer. The Sephora attendant grabbed me by the hand and recommended an entire skincare routine of which this oil was the main player. I wore it that night and the next morning my skin was significantly less red. In the week that I’ve been using it, my skin has cleared up. I have combination oily skin and was skeptical about using an oil at first and while my skin was a bit on the oily side in the first couple of days, &5 has balanced itself out. I will definitely be repurchasing!',\n",
       " 'I heard about this somewhere that this would be good for oily skin and acne prone skin. I bought on a whim, with very little expectations. And I ended up loving it! The formula can be very heavy. I recommend this at night, not for the day. It is good for dry, winter air. I have oily skin, like really oily, and this helps tame a lot of this without making me breakout. I get this healthy glow and I really love it. I don’t use it every night, maybe 2-3 times a week and it really helps my skin. This is great for an addition to a regular skin routine as an added bonus in place of moisturizer before bed. But if you live in a humid place, be careful. It might get too oily for you, despite being made specifically for oily skin. But I always recommend it to all my friends. I am on my second bottle and will buy again and again.',\n",
       " 'I heard a lot of good reviews on how it treats acne. I felt lucky I only got a sample and did not buy it. It did not do anything with my acne accept leaving my face oily. Ugh.',\n",
       " 'I have oily skin and I kept reading about face oils being super amazing for trying to tame the oil production. I spoke with my local Sephora skin care spealist about what I was looking to accomplish and he immediatly had me try the CLARINS Lotus Face oil. I actually didn’t put it in my bag right Way because of the price!! But something told me to splurge and I DID! I will NEVER let myself run out of his life changing oil. I use it every day directly after i cleanse and dry my face completely. 3 drops, rub between my fingers and rub it all in!Y ITS LIKE I HAVE NEW SKIN!!!!!!',\n",
       " 'I have an oily skin and I’m over 45. I’ve been using this during the day and feels my skin very hydrated. I think is wonderful for winter when my skin requires more protection.',\n",
       " 'I received this as a sample and had little to no expectations from this product. I have been pleasantly surprised.\\r\\rI have rosacea, oily skin and large pores. I apply this in the evening after cleansing and allow it to absorb about 5 minutes then apply my night cream.  Within 2 days I noticed a dramatic decrease in blackheads, whiteheads and pore size. Skin is clear and clean.\\r\\rOn my chest area I am extremely sensitive to creams, fabric softener, anything really. It is ALWAYS  red, itchy and inflamed. Nothing to date has worked on this area like this product has. I apply it in the same way I do for my face, apply it after cleansing and apply my chest/neck cream afterwards. Since using my chest area is clear, redness is almost completely gone and inflammation is 90% reduced. \\r\\rVery impressed.Will be purchasing the full size bottle.',\n",
       " 'I have very oily skin, and I mean oily.\\rThis smelled quite good, a little strong though. This oily does not get absorbed quickly, at least on my skin, it did not.  Also, unfortunately, too heavy for me, made me broke out so bad.',\n",
       " 'Love the smell and works great',\n",
       " 'This oil is quite reasonably priced in comparison to other high street brands and it is very effective for oil- prone/Acneic skin. I’ve seen a reduction in spots and less oil production during the day. I use this at night only. I’ve yet to find a product as effective as this. I haven’t used it consecutively but when I do return to it, I see a visible improvement with any breakouts.',\n",
       " 'I’m loving it! I haven’t notice a dramatic difference in my blackheads, but it definitely tightens my pores. \\rI have combo skin so I’m using it only on my t zone. It’s not really drying but not moisturizing at all',\n",
       " 'pretty decent oil with heavy flowery smell. i didn’t do anything on my face. i used it double of times on my hand and legs worked better. for the results i think it worth half a price and i did use most of the bottle.',\n",
       " 'I’ve willing to give this oil a try for quite a while, but I was afraid since I have oily skin. It works really well and did not gave me breakouts or made my skin oilier. Quite the opposite, I feel like my skin is behaving better along the day. I use at night, after cleaning my skin. For about two weeks I’ve using it alone. It also improved A LOT some fine lines that recently showed up on my forehead. As for making pores less visible, I am not sure yet, maybe, but may be just for improving my oily skin. I need more time to have an opinion on that. The smell is quite odd, not bad, just a bit weird. Feels really good to massage it to your face, and whatever is left on my fingers I use on the back of my hands. I just start using it along with retinoic acid, so far so good.',\n",
       " 'I was originally going to get the Blue Orchid oil based on a Youtube video I saw, but it isn’t carried in stores so I got this instead.  I’ve used this for a couple of weeks now I think my skin condition is improving (combo/oily).  It has a unique smell, but it’s fine.',\n",
       " 'I have tried so many different products to clear my acne and nothing seemed to work. I even go to the dermatologist and nothing seemed like it was helping. When I first saw this product I was terrifed! I have oil skin and I thought theres no way this is going to help....but it did! Ever since I have been using this product I have noticed I havent been getting acne...seriously no joke this stuff is totally worth the money!! I have had it for awhile now too so it lasts awhile. Definitely recommend!!!',\n",
       " 'OK y’all this stuff is beyond amazing! First let me say I’ve never in my life used any oil on my face, I’ve always been too nervous to apply oil on my face! BUT I’m so glad I tried this stuff!!! I’m 30 with sensitive, combo/oily, cystic-acne prone skin. I feel like I’ve got my skin routine down, finally after years of trying to figure my skin out! I had a sample of the oil, with really no intention of using it. But I had a major cystic breakout, after having a dark chocolate bar! I had not eaten chocolate in quite a while, so I think that is what triggered my out break. So out of desperation I thought I would try this oil since I was told it does wonders for acne. And I’m telling you I was beyond amazed! I put this on my fresh cleansed skin, 3 drops. Rub the oil in your palms and pat onto your face. The first night I used it I just used the oil, woke up with my face almost matte and the cysts were dramatically reduced, and my skin just looked more radiant !! So the next night I used it and put my moisturizer over top, woke up with my cysts almost gone, and my skin was radiant!! My pores have tightened, blackheads on my nose that I’ve had all my life seem to have melted away, & my skin in the morning is barely oily! This oil is supposed to purify and balance skin, and that’s just what it does!! I also use it under my primer and it doesn’t make me oily, just soft radiant skin! I just apply the oil at least 15 minutes before I apply my makeup so it can absorb! If you have oily or acne prone skin try this, you won’t regret it!! I’m using it everyday as a preventive, and if I do get a cyst I’ll apply a tad extra on the cyst itself. I love this oil, I’m a believer in oils now! I also love that this is all natural, and how it is created to purify your skin.',\n",
       " 'I love using face oil including this oil. It’s moisturizing although it doesn’t really help with my very oily skin. I only use 2 drops max per usage and rub it in my hands first before applying to my face. I think this product really takes a long time to finish off... that I’ve been using all over my body too like hands and legs. Smells heavenly!',\n",
       " 'This product has been great, I really enjoy using it in the mornings, usually every other day (switching off with other products). It helps keep oil at bay, and my skin can get quite oily. It is a nice oil texture and smells good. I haven’t experienced any breakouts from this product, I think it has helped keep breakouts away!',\n",
       " 'Being a VIB ROUGE member you can imagine I’ve tried everything for oily skin around, but this year in a trip to Russia I decided to try this oil. My pores disappeared in less than 3 days of use. Since Sephora has a really good policy for returning products I suggest you oily girls like me, give it a try!! I hope it works for you as good as it works for me!! (ps: I’m restocking mine right now)',\n",
       " 'This product was recommended to me in store by Sephora employee when I was searching for a new face regime because I’d felt that my previous one could be improved. Initially, the product worked well, until I broke out on both my cheeks, which had never happened for me. I continued usage because I thought it was just ’that time of the month,’ but unfortunately, it continued until I decided to take this out of my routine. Thereafter, the whiteheads stopped emerging and my now-existing acne began to heal. Judging by my skin for the first few days, the face oil did slightly lessen the production of oils throughout the day, but with the severity of the breakouts, this product had to be returned. It might work for others, but this just wasn’t for my skin!',\n",
       " 'Clarins Lotus face oil is great. It’s lightweight and does not clog your pores. The best part of this oil is it smells soooo Good. I absolutely love putting this oil treatment on each night. I’ve tried other facial oils and most of them do not smell good. If you try this once, you will love it!',\n",
       " 'I bought this after reading reviews about how this is some sort of miracle treatment for oily skin....unfortunately this did absolutely nothing for my oily skin. I had high hopes as other Clarins products have worked well, but this oil really only served as a fragrance oil for me. When I put it on I still needed to use a moisturizer because my skin felt very dry.When I purchased the product, the Sephora salesperson said she uses it on her cuticles to soften them, so I thought that might be a better way to use the oil, but sadly it still was not moisturizing enough. Maybe it works well for other skin types, but this did nothing for my oily skin.',\n",
       " 'I can’t describe how happy I am to find this product here at Sephora--it was discontinued from Clarins’ lineup for a long time! I was plagued with acne as a teenager and young adult in my 20s as my skin was constantly like an oil slick! Blotting papers, blotting powders, astringent, you name it--nothing helped, and my face always had a constant shine until I discovered Clarins Huile Lotus about 15-20 years ago. Regular use every night and morning helped me gain control of my oily skin until one day I went to the Clarins counter only to find this had been discontinued! As I got older, my skin became less oily, but it’s still oily by many standards. I’m 39 now and still have oily skin, and while that’s good for keeping wrinkles and fine lines at bay, it’s hard to keep makeup from sliding off my face. When I saw this recently on Sephora’s website I did a double take and immediately ordered it! After just a week, I can already tell the oil production is subsiding and pretty soon I won’t need to keep blotting papers in my purse! It also smells so natural and pretty--I just love it! I may stockpile this in case Clarins decides to discontinue again--that’s how much I love it! Really changed my life! Thank you, Sephora, for carrying it!',\n",
       " 'Bought this end of July last year just because it said to help with pores and texture. Tbh, I haven’t noticed any changes regarding that. But as time progressed, whenever I would take my powder out for touch-ups (3-4 times a day was my normal average) I would put it back because I didn’t need any. I didn’t think much of it until my friend asked what foundation I was using for me not to look like a grease-ball as I usually do and I told her that the Lotus Oil was the only new addition in terms of face products. Now at that point I wasn’t totally convinced I needed this because the results I got from it wasn’t the reason I purchased it. That is until I stopped using it for a couple of weeks and went back to powdering my face every three hours or so. I went back to using three drops every night, lesson learned.',\n",
       " 'Rarely do I trouble with writing reviews, so this must be good stuff. I’ve used this less than a week and already my skin looks and feels much better. It definitely helps control the shine, minimizes oil, and it seems that the slight reddish tint around my mouth and on my cheeks is starting to disappear. The difference was noticeable even by the third use. For reference, my skin is combination/oily, definitely closer to the oily side of the spectrum, and usually resembles an oil slick by lunchtime. I have regular breakouts in my T-zone and lately along my jawline. I wash my face twice a day now, morning and evening, warm up just one-two drops of this oil with a small amount of moisturizer with my fingers, then press it into the skin - no rubbing. When I wake in the morning, my face feels soft (with a slight sheen), but not dirty/greasy. For daytime, there is only the barest hint of shine by late evening, usually after about 10-12 hours. I should mention, though, I made another change to my daily routine; I began using the Clinique anti-blemish foundation. I believe this helps, as well, but with the results of this oil, I feel more comfortable without any foundation at all. The smell is strong, but I don’t find it unpleasant. Give it a try!',\n",
       " 'Thought it was working for the first 2-3 days I was using it, but it started to make me break out! I was hoping it was something else, but this was the only new thing to my night-time regime. I have sensitive skin, and I live in the north so my skin has been a bit flaky. I was hoping this could help with that, but I just started to get some acne around my lip area. I ended up returning it!',\n",
       " 'I have the most sensitive skin of life so I was really nervous about implementing this in my daily routine. It smells amazing and my skin has never been softer or less irritated. Now I have this amazing glow on my skin, especially my tzone area. My skin is brighter and much softer with less breakouts after only 3 wks! I even put a drop or two in my hair and it makes it look great. This one gets 50 gold stars!!!',\n",
       " 'After years of using harsh products to deal with oiliness, large pores, breakouts, and scarring/discoloration, it was very counterintuitive for me to try an oil. But I had seen this one featured somewhere, and thought why not? I’m so glad I did! After the first use at night, I woke up with all of the above issues much more under control. With continued use, I feel like I have different skin! Tone has completely evened out, oiliness is balanced (my skin glows, no longer shines - trust me, there is a difference!). Most notably perhaps, my pores have disappeared. This is a claim I never expect to come true, but I was shocked that after the first few days of use, they had vanished, and left behind firmer and more tightened skin. I use this mostly at night (though it’s fine to use in the day - it’s that versatile) over an exfoliating toner. Unlike the popular “dry“ oils, I feel this absorbs completely info your skin and does not just sit on its surface, making it slick.',\n",
       " 'I’ve been using this product for about 1y now. I’m almost done with my 1st bottle. So, after daily use for almost 1y, I’ve seen zero results. My face is still oily - it did not seem to control any of the oiliness, independent on the season. The ONLY thing I noticed was that, during the winter, even after a full week of skiing, my skin wasn’t dry. I’d use 1-2 extra drops of this oil (total 4-5 drops) before bed and my skin would be alright in the morning.So, if you have combination/oily skin, this product will do nothing for you. But it’s glamorous.',\n",
       " 'I have oily acne prone skin so naturally I was hesitant to buy this face oil. However, it works really well. I only use it at night (2 drops in my hand and I press and release onto my cheeks and forehead). It looks oily for a minute but then absorbs nicely leaving soft skin. It has helped control my oil in general. I was having bad breakouts on my cheeks and chin area and those have subsided (with the help of other acne products). I love the smell of the rosewood, which is somewhat calming.',\n",
       " 'I started using this in the winter at the suggestion of a sales person at the Clarins counter. I like the way it smells and the light-weight feel of it. However, after about 2 weeks of using this regularly, I started to breakout with tiny whiteheads on my forehead. Had to stop using it. I’m giving it two stars because I’m sure it works great for others but I wouldn’t recommend for acne-prone skin.',\n",
       " 'Works great for oily skin in the summer but in the winter time , it may be too drying for oily skin. don’t know why this would be. It might be because of the astringent properties. Clarins advisors in other stores disagree who this oil is good for , but Sephora is pretty consistent and accurate',\n",
       " 'As recommended by a Sephora beauty consultant, I pat this oil on my cheeks and around the orbital area AFTER applying all products and makeup and then lay a tissue over application to absorb excess. What I have is the “glow“ so often advertised by other products, but have never achieved. The real test...after a full day of teaching 8th graders, I don’t look exhausted! Still glowing!!',\n",
       " 'I wasn’t sure about putting an oil on my face, but I tried it and love it. I like to use it on my face after a shower so it soaks into my skin. Very refreshing,and my skin is soft not greasy in the morning.',\n",
       " 'Noticeably has cleared up my t-zone from minor blemishes and has also tightened my pores. It has a strong smell but I use it mainly at night and doesn’t cause me to break out since I have really sensitive skin. Makes your skin so soft as well!!',\n",

       " 'For years now, I have alternated between Clarins Blue Orchid Oil (in colder weather) and Lotus (in the warmer months). It seems counter-intuitive to use an oil product on oily skin but Lotus Oil truly does help to balance out the oilier part of my face and - amazingly - seems to help loosen stubborn clogs/blackheads on my nose so they are easier to extract. Honestly, the essential oils in this product really do help balance out oil production gently and without a lot of harsh scrubbing or stripping of the skin with strong products. Such a gentle and pleasant experience using this. Just remember - this is for NIGHT TIME use...don’t try using it UNDER makeup in the daytime.',\n",
       " 'I have sensitive skin and acne prone skin, using the wrong product will clog my pores and break me out. I also have dry patches on my nose and forehead. This product has not made me breakout at all, and I feel it has help controlled some of my breakouts. I usually get menstrual breakouts on my chin, this month however, I haven’t seen any form, the oil has really helped to purify my skin. The dry patches have subsided and has allowed for easier application of my foundation. I use 3 drops every night before bed, (after my toner, but before my moisturizer) pressing the oil on to my skin, focusing on my nose, chin, and forehead. It smells like a plant, kind of like eucalyptus. I love this product, and I feel it is going to last a long time because I use such a small amount each time. However, when I do run out, I will be purchasing it again.',\n",
       " 'When I was a teenager my skin was quite oily. Now, I’m 26 and while I am consistently broken out (red spots, very few actual bumps) and I’m also quite dry to top it off. After reading the reviews I was really excited to try it. I put it on after using an exfoliating wipe, and then washing my face with purity (love). It’s not the most flattering look since it appears so oily. However, my skin is so soft in the morning when I wake up that I really don’t care what I look like at night. Using this oil nightly has helped my makeup go on much more smoothly during the day since my skin is no longer flakey. It’s worked so well for me. I haven’t noticed a difference in my acne/redness, but because it helps so well with my dryness I really don’t mind.',\n",
       " 'I put a pinch on my skin, which is normal-dry. And I looked like I had been in the kitchen all day long frying chicken. Terrible, I had to wash my face twice to get the oil out. It was recommended highly, but really regret buying it.',\n",
       " 'I really wanted to like this product. Although it does leave your skin soft & u dont need a lot of drops..BUT ...I cannot stand the smell. And if you have a headache, forget it. That smell will really get to you....the smell of the oil is a dead ringer.',\n",
       " 'I was given a sample of this and i immediately fell in love this product and purchased it. I have acne prone combination skin and I felt it evened out my skin texture and helped reduce my breakouts. It wasn’t a life changer but is definitely will purchase again because of the results I’ve seen thus far. But it is a bit pricey for an oil.',\n",
       " 'I have sensitive fair skin and this enlarged my pores and broke me out. Mind you I only used 1-2 drops. I really wanted this to work but it was a no go for me :/',\n",

       " 'It really controls your excessive oil. I am oil/combine skin and after apply this, my skin keeps clean and non-oily all day. Strongly recommend it.',\n",
       " 'First, let me say that it’s take a LONG time to learn that if you’re not born with flawless skin, then when it comes to taking care of it, LESS is MORE. I totally believe in using minimal products to balance the skin rather than trying every new exfoliating serum, brush, mask, you name it - I’ve tried it all and have done too much.I got back into using facial oils about 5 years ago, kind of off an on, before every major cosmetics brand was pushing their products. First used Dr. Hauschka’s Normalizing Day Oil, then forgot about it - obviously it didn’t change my life. Then went really far out there and used natural Emu oil on my skin. I had read that it was especially healing for scars, and I wanted to see if it could minimize some light acne scarring I had gotten in my early 20’s. I’m not 31, for the record.More recently, I’ve used the Josie Maran Argan Oil, it was good, but didn’t notice immediate results. Then got the Boscia Tsubaki Oil, which I did really like.About two months ago I was cornered by a Clarins rep in a Sephora in West Palm Beach, FL, and she really convinced me to try their stuff. I left with a new moisturizer, and facial serum in addition to a generous sample of the Lotus Oil.This is the best yet.I will add now that I only exfoliate, gently, once a week - even though I want to do more to try to get rid of some congested spots, or clogged pores on my nose - and this oil has really done wonderful things when it comes to balancing out my skin’s oil production.I used to have many bumps, built-up sebum, that have just started to melt away after using this nightly. I was instructed to use this only at night, and not add anything to it. I’ve done so religiously and after about 5 weeks don’t use any makeup to blend my skin tone or cover redness.I highly recommend getting this OR getting a little sample, it’ll last forever!',\n",
       " 'I was ecstatic about trying this oil. I researched face oils extensively, prior to my purchase. I have combo skin (VERY oily in the T-Zone). After reading great reviews of the Lotus Oil on several websites, I decided (skeptically) to give it a shot. Pros: the scent is really calming and nice, the oil GOES ON light, and a little goes a long way. Cons: It made my already oily T-Zone, an oil slick, did not absorb well into my skin (despite using a face brush and exfoliating prior to every application), and despite using exactly as recommended, for 3 weeks, there was no difference in my skin (other than it was more oily). Thank you, Sephora, for your generous return policy This is going back tomorrow.',\n",
       " 'I have sensitive acne prone skin, I break out with almost everything skin are wise or I will get really irritated, a month ago my skin was in an awful state, I felt it was time to upgrade my skin care routine, I headed to sephora and met with a skincare professional, he took one look at my sin and made me put almost everything I have in my caddy back, he recommended a couple of Clarins products including this oil, I use 1-2 drops at night alone and 2 drops with my Murad skin perfecting lotion and since then my skin has done done nothing but improve, it’s clear, supple, smooth, my rosacea has disappeared which was terrible on my chine, I mean dry red and irritated, now my skin looks amazing, I feel comfortable without makeup, I couldn’t leave without foundation cause of my bad skin, now it’s great, I even updated some of my face makeup and viola perfection!',\n",
       " 'I had used this several years ago, and realized my oil was no longer potent. I bought the new oil, used just as said with the toner still on. I put on forehead, nose and chin. My chin started to break out! I am not sure if it was from this? I am taking a few days off and will try again as I have a very oily T-Zone.',\n",
       " 'This oil is amazing! It smells like a grapefruit rind, and if you are sensitive I would steer clear. If you don’t mind that citrus scent, this will do amazing things for your skin. Use 4-7 drops alone or mixed in with your moisturizer and my complexion actually cleared up! Softer and more vibrant skin resulted. I was surprised that an oil would not break me out, and instead make my skin better. Expensive, but at 4-7 drops, this will last over 4 months at least. Worth every penny... just don’t spill it like I did!',\n",
       " 'I am so in love with this product. I can’t imagine I had lived so far without it. I had very bad cystic acne that just would not go away with any treatment I tried. Seriously, for 10+ years, I struggled with acne. Now, I do not recognize my skin. It’s just been so amazing for me, plus I cannot live without the deliciously intoxicating smell of this oil. I bought some for my sister as well, and her skin looks great too. THANK YOU! <3',\n",

AMAZING. I am prone to breakouts and always using an acne cream, which dires out my skin, three drops of this patted onto my skin works beautifully... it is not greasy, or heavy - smells heavenly and leaves skin super soft.',\n",

I have rather sensitive acne prone skin and I used this product consistently for a good two months and just felt my skin getting more irritated. I may try it again in the summer time but, until then I’m going to pass on it.In general though I like that it absorbed well into my skin and did not leave me greasy looking. Also, I thought the smell was a bit strange at first (kind of herb-like) but, I really came to like the scent. It also does feel nice on the skin but was not as moisturizing as I was hoping.',\n",

I have combo skin, leaning more towards the dry side right now because of the winter but I didn’t want anything too “oily“ so I purchased the Lotus Facial Oil (generally for oily skin) and I absolutely love it! Next time I may try the one for dehydrated skin but for right now I’m loving this.',\n",

Also, my skin tone is just not cute without makeup because I usually have a lot of little red dots on my face that are like mini acne I guess. NOT AFTER THIS WEEK! Literally all my skin problems have gone away after using this oil for only a week. This review might be premature since its been such a short amount of time, but I can say with full confidence that it has never looked this good. It’s important to note that I use this with Clarins Iris toner so the combo might help a lot as well.',\n",

This oil has the most amazing herbal scent ever, feels like a spa in a bottle, it can be too strong for some but for me it is very relaxing. My skin looks better than ever it is smooth, soft, and radiant (not greasy). $50 is a heafty price tag so if you’re not sure go to sephora and get a sample(mine lasted me a month!), that is what I did to make sure that buying an oil for my face was actually the right decision.

I was using the tarte oil and it works just fine. but I was looking for something with more results. so I decided to order this and give it a try. not the only shrink your pores it also helps your skin look brighter more even. and to top it all off it has amazing smile. I just love this stuff and I will be buying it again.',\n",

I’ve used it for a couple of weeks now and I am already starting to notice a decrease in my wrinkles and lines on my eyes and mouth areas. I would definitely recommend this to someone who wants to see fast results. Really great face cream.',\n",

       " 'Very luxe, treat yourself! This crème fondante is as luxurious as the name sounds. It’s thick, hydrating, soft, buttery and absorbs into your skin with no greasy after effect. It really feels amazing on your skin and super hydrating. It has a soft scent that seems to dissipate quickly. While this may seem pricey, if you are looking for something to hydrate, firm, give a glow, and plump your skin this is it! The packaging is very luxe too. I am completely pleased with this crème. I received this product from Bzzagent for an honest review and I feel this is honest. If you want a luxurious crème to treat yourself and splurge, a little goes a long way, get this!',\n",
       " 'I couldn’t believe the price on this product. It’s very concentrated and a little goes a long way. It has a pretty strong rose scent if that’s not something you’re a fan of. My face feels supple and moisturized after using it. I have had a recent breakout and not sure if this is the cause. I’ll definitely finish the jar but can’t see myself repurchasing it.',\n",

My skin is now super soft, smooth and supple. I’ve even had people ask what foundation I use to make my skin look so good and we’re surprised to know that I don’t wear any! My only take away is that it does make my already oily skin a lot more oily so I couldn’t give it a full 5 stars.',\n",
       " 'Love this. Absolute soft cream   I did receive this as a free gift to give my. Honest opinion and I do have to say that this product is amazing it does give the moisture with out being heavy and living in a dry part of the country it helps tremendously without making me feel oily.  The scent is light and after a few minutes you don’t smell or notice the pleasant rose.',\n",

I have used it for a few weeks now, and the results have been amazing! I’ve been using it morning and night,and my face is simply glowing! My fine lines are a lot less noticeable than they were a month ago. This Moisturizer is so silky and luxurious feeling. This makes me look forward to my skincare routine so much more. It’s pricey, but it’s my little treat to myself. I will definitely be repurchasing this! Highly recommend!',\n",
       " 'The only product I’ve ever bought a second jar as a gift while still using it. I have extreme combination skin with my t-zone being so oily I have to wipe it down before I go on Zoom meetings or the glare would blind people. At the same time, my cheeks are rough and dry and feel scaley. This is the first cream that felt like it was fully moisturizing me without leaving me as an oil slick. When I opened the jar it felt completely lux and the scent is that perfect blend of rose without it being overpowering. The cream glides on without a greasy feeling and is soaked in quickly leaving it feeling soft and dewy.The first two weeks it was all topical, my skin did feel softer after application but that was about it, now the 3rd week is when I noticed some of the uneven tones and hyperpigmentation soften. They were still there, but they seemed to be less and I need to use less foundation to cover it.The fourth week in is when I noticed the fine fine lines under my eyes starting to look fuller and less deep. My MIL asked me if I was getting more sleep. That’s when I fell in love with this cream, she’s not one to give out compliments so it was a big deal for her. I ended up buying her a jar and I hope she loves it as much as I do.',\n",
       " 'Lovely scent and initial impression is old school in a chic new way. I was fortunate to obtain this as part of a sampling promotion- thus I’m torn if I would’ve spent over $200 on this cream. However, I DID notice brightening of my skin (mid 30s with sun dark spots and darkened eye circles), as well as reduction in darkening at creases of my eyes. Loved it!',\n",
       " 'I love love this cream. I combined using it with the Lancôme triple serum in the purple and silver tube and my skin looks amazing!!! I will definitely be purchasing this item again as well as the serum. I received it to try for review.',\n",

       " 'I have recently started trying Lancome products as part of my beauty routine and I must say I love this one. The scent is so soothing and my skin feels really soft an supple. I do see some difference in the skin texture in terms of ageing but will comment on that post long term use. But I love the fact that this works perfectly for combination type skin as well and like most moisturizers I did not experience any breakouts. So far m loving this cream and I use it as part of my night time routine.',\n",
       " 'I grew up with my grandmother using Lancome, so I was excited to try this. First of all, the packaging is beautiful and at 42 I’m always looking for a good facial moisturizer. I really like it, it’s moisturizing and smells great. My mother even tried it and asked me to send her a picture of the container so she could buy her own.',\n",
       " 'For my skin, this was amazing. This was a part of a free trial and I did push my response to the very end of the tome I had to respond, which probably annoyed bzzagent, but I feel like it gave me a better opportunity to really use the product. As much as I would love to be completely consistent with my skincare routine, I’m not 100%. I over sleep, have late nights, feel sick, get busy, etc, just like most people.  This is not about my habits, but this product, which is, amazing.  It moisturized the dry spots, didn’t over saturate the oily spots,  my skin looked and felt more even, my foundation looked smoother. Would recommend to eomen my age, for sure. Why the 4 stars?  It’s not affordable. Probably the women who could most benefit from this product, also arent dropping $130 a jar on it..ijs. Should a premium product be available at a “price point“  well no, but also...',\n",
       " 'I was super excited to try this as I received a full sized sample of the Lancome Absolue Soft Cream Revitalizing & Brightening Moisturizer in return for an honest review!  I used it for a little over two weeks and it does give your skin a beutiful glow and brightening effect upon application, however I didn’t notice any difference in the appearance of my skin.  I did have immediate breakouts on my chin as I got use to it, which I didn’t enjoy.  The overall scent is overpowering, and since I am sensitive to smell this was also an issue for me.  Overall I would not recommend for people sensitive to strong perfumes.',\n",
       " 'Smell amazing and moisturizing. The texture is smooth and absorbed well on the skin. Feels a little greasy for me but it tones up my pores and fine lines. Does not help with acne scar but I feel like my acne is under control since I started using it too.',\n",
       " 'I loved the luxuriousness of this cream. It has a great feel, goes on so easily & smoothly, and hydrates like no other. A little bit goes a long way and I love that the gorgeous gold packaging is refillable. However, I have oily skin, so after a while, the moisture just builds up on my face & it needs to be blotted. I definitely recommend for someone with less oily skin!',\n",
       " 'My five stars may seem odd, but hear me out! This product didn’t work for me - too greasy on my skin, no matter how little I applied. That said, it was perfect for my Mom’s skin - she absolutely loves it! Who doesn’t love Lancôme? The packaging is beautiful,  no need to put this one in your medicine cabinet - leave it out! The fragrance emitted from the rose - it’s all perfect - for my Mom’s skin!',\n",

I in my late 40’s and have tried every high end moisturizer on the market for the last 20 years. I am a former beauty advisor for multiple cosmetic companies and this ranks in the top 2 for quality and my personal results ever. Packaging is sleek and pristine and looks gorgeous on my vanity as well. I couldn’t want for more. The usage in my photo is from at least a month of daily use—a little goes far, so would be worth the price point to me when I purchase.',\n",

I was looking for a hydrating cream that I could use at night to balance out my skin care routine. This cream worked well. Not only did it hydrate hut I have noticed that my hyperpigmentation due to the sun has lightened a bit (a few weeks). I am really picky about my moisturizers because my sensitive skin breaks out easily. I had no major breakouts because of the Absolue. It took care of my needs. The rose scent is a beautiful added bonus!',\n",

This Lancôme night cream is, by far, the best of that brand! And compared to other brands, I’d say it ranks somewhere in the top 5. The cream smells amazing without being overpowering. It is thick and creamy without being heavy.    Using this cream regularly will definitely result in a softer more supple face in the morning.   I was given this cream for free in exchange for an honest review, but I will definitely be buying some once mine runs out.',\n",
       " 'This moisturizer is elegant and absolutely luxe. I have combination skin so I was hesitant to use it during the day under makeup at first but it was just as great feeling as overnight. It keeps my skin hydrated workout feeling greasy and goopy. It has a faint smell of roses which doesn’t irritate my skin at all. I have already recommended it to several friends and will definitely be buying more! I would definitely be interested in buying a formula that included some spf in the future.',\n",
       " 'Love this product! After using for a week, my skin is smoother, both in texture and pigment. I see a reduction of fine lines as well. I also LOVE the scent. I am sensitive to too much fragrance but this is perfect. Plus I love rose, so this is great! Highly recommend!',\n",
       " 'I “absolutely” love Lancome Absolue soft cream! It is so creamy and rich and hydrates my skin, instantly refreshing it and making it feel and smell good for hours. I love the light floral scent and the soft texture. It feels so luxurious and is my new favorite premium beauty product!',\n",
       " 'This must be the most luxurious moisturizer I have ever used. My favorite part is the scent as it leaves you with a truly rose scent lingering in the air for the entire night. Quality: The moisturizer did a great job evening and brightening my skin tone. I used it morning and evening for three weeks and see a significant improvement in my skin texture. My skin was really radiant in the morning and my foundation make up applied on more smoothly. I have sensitive skin and did not have any breakouts which I typically get from moisturizers advertised to provide such great hydration. Appearance: The moisturizer is a beautiful pink shade and combined with the rose scent truly makes you feel luxurious. The bottle is a beautiful gold finish which looks nice on any counter and I could imagine the entire skin care line together would make a nice display. This moisturizer was so great it reinvigorated my entire skin care routine. I enjoyed washing my face every night and prepping my skin. With this renewed skin care, I even noticed my hyperpigmentation start to lighten. I highly recommend the moisturizer for a radiant glow.',\n",
       " 'Oh My Goodness! I have never been so blown away by a product before! I know this is pricey BUT so very worth it! I have been battling redness for years and have tried lots of products and only had temporary relief. First, this smells amazing! Second, the feel of this creme is so luxurious that you just want to wear it all over! third, it does amazing things to your face! after a few days it completely took my redness away! I’m sold!  I even wear it under my makeup and have gone makeup-free most days. Changed the texture of my skin and made me look younger. I no longer wear primer or moisturizer under my makeup base.',\n",

I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks now, and I have to say I’m not to impressed with it.  The main thing I disliked about it was it’s scent.  To me the scent is far to strong for a facial moisturizer.  It’s definitely a rose floral scent, and reminded me of an old lady.  It did leave my skin soft and supple, but I honestly didn’t notice any difference with my fine lines.  For the price, I would have expected to see a little bit more of a difference with my fine lines and the appearance of my skin.I felt the consistency was a little to thick for my liking, but a tiny bit did go a long way.My recommendation would be to save your money, and buy something you and your skin really loves.',\n",

It left my skin velvety soft and within a week I could see a definite improvement in my hydration level and my skin appeared bright. This is definitely going to remain my splurge product. If you’re unsure, go for it! Spoil yourself. You won’t regret it.',\n",
       " 'Wow! I’m so in love with the Absolue Soft Cream! I felt instant hydration and moisture! You will see an amazing glow after application. It’s pricey but sooo good! Very lightweight and creamy! This is truly a luxury facial cream! The only thing missing is a fancy applicator. I’m in love with this moisturizer. Definitely worth a try and I will definitely purchase.',\n",

I use it morning and night because I love it. it works well on my skin. i have oily combo and have no issues with it increasing my oil production.  I use a thin layer morning and night. I stopped using my serum during the trial. I don’t need it.  This moisturizer is amazing.  My skin feels and looks amazing with my foundation on.  This is worth the price. I am in my 50’s and my skin feels amazing.',\n",
       " 'This is a fantastic cream! I use tretinoin at night, so my face tends to need some extra moisture. This cream is a wonderful addition to my routine and it feels so luxurious. A little goes a long way, which is nice considering the very high price point. But it sinks into my skin well and leaves my skin feeling so soft by the morning. It has a bit of fragrance, but I am not bothered by fragrance in my skincare. Also, it does not seem to irritate my acne prone skin so far.',\n",
       " 'Love this luxurious 3-in-1 cream! It is very gentle to my very sensitive skin, even when I had skin rash issue that needs a powerful moisturizer. After using for a week I can tell that the cream helps bring out a smoother skin with more elasticity. I haven’t experienced a noticeably brighter skin after a 1-2 week use but it seems to help improve my uneven skin tone. Longer use might bring the full benefits. Overall very satisfied with Lancome products (Genefiqe, Tri serum) and this one in particular. It is quite affordable if on sale.',\n",
       " 'I got to try this free sample of Absolue Soft Cream. After using for a week and half, my skin appeared brighter and softer. My coloring evened out and my face stayed moisturized throughout the day. I highly recommend this product along with other Lancôme products. The science they use to deliver a top notch product is noticeable in only a few short weeks.',\n",
       " 'I used Lacome Absolue for a week straight at night before bed by itself and saw vast improvements not only in my skin feeling very moisturized but also clearer and brighter.  It has a silky texture when applying and after applying makes my face and neck feel amazingly soft and supple.  I also saw skin firming as well after a full week of use.  After the first week I paired it with Lancôme Renergie for my morning skin routine and have used both products now together for about a week and I’m seriously impressed!  I don’t have to add any other products for moisturizing or any other serums as my face has never looked better and I can’t wait to see what this does after long term use!',\n",
       " 'I really loved this product! I did get this product for free for my honest review. I’ve been using this at night for 3 weeks now. It is a nice, thicker creme. I have very oily skin so to use during daytime was a bit to moisturizing. This was a perfect night creme as the last step in my skincare routine. There is a slight floral smell but nothing to aggressive and goes away pretty fast. Every morning when I woke up my face felt so soft and supple. My face definitely looked a bit brighter and more even. I can’t say 100% to just this, but worked into a skin care routine is a perfect fit. The only thing that I don’t like is the price tag. It was fantastic and I got results, but I’m not sure it’s worth the $130 price tag. I’m sure there are other products that work just as well for a cheaper price point.',\n",

It isn’t too thick and goes on very light. A little goes a long way. I wear this at night and my skin feels hydrated and firm the next morning. I will be using this every night as part of my daily skin routine!',\n",
       " 'Absolu has a lovely rose smell. I applied this thick, soft cream nightly and saw a new bright glowing skin result. I generally do not enjoy scented products yet the scent of Absolu is very subtle. I love it! I highly recommend this beautiful face cream.',\n",
       " 'This is a luxurious moisturizer. Thick and creamy consistency but amazingly lightweight once applied to your face. After two weeks of use the improvements were slight, but extremely encouraging.  My skin is softer, and the tone is becoming more radiant. I am excited to continue using this product. The smell of this cream is wonderful. It is not floral or medicinal, but a clean fresh scent.I have oily skin and this cream did not make me look any oilier.  This product did not irritate or breakout my skin.',\n",

I did see a brighter complexion and skin was glowing the following day. Scent is very light and pleasant. But compared to others such as Chanel or La Mer, this Lancome Absolue did not compare in terms of luxury.',\n",
       " 'OK-so I couldn’t take a picture of my face before using this product as I was on a cruise.  But what a lifesaver this was on that cruise!  I had a sunburn on my face since I haven’t laid out for the entire pandemic!! :) So, when I realized I hadn’t put on enough sunblock, I was so happy I had thrown this in my bag.  It is cream, but absorbed into the skin without rigorous rubbing, a good thing for someone over 50-trying to not add any wrinkles.  I will also add that this product smells divine.  I have worked in cosmetics in the past and many times the smell of something impacts the usage since no one wants to have something that does not smell good on their face!',\n",
       " 'This moisturizer that Lancôme came out with is absolutely amazing! After using this for about two weeks my skin is softer, brighter, and more moisturized. I also really liked how the Lacome Absolute has little to no smell.',\n",

I used this product 1-2X a day for a couple of weeks after I received it as part of a sampling campaign. I’ll continue to use it until it’s finished. It was moisturizing and did not irritate my skin. While using it I didn’t have any dry patches, that can sometimes plague me this time of year, however it didn’t seem to help with healing my break outs faster. It does smell like roses, and wasn’t too strong in my opinion. That being said I think the price point is a little high.I’m giving it 4 stars, because I think it does the job and is one of the best (though not the best) moisturizers I’ve ever tried in my life. I did not give it 5 stars, because the price makes me feel like it should’ve been the best moisturizer I’ve ever tried.',\n",
       " 'This cream is very light and silky. Truly very very silky. My skin feels very smooth and moisturized. I’m not sure about brightening part. I do have a lot of hyper pigmentation and few sun spots, and can’t say that they change at all in the appearance. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks, so maybe I should just give it more time.',\n",

The days I’m using Lancôme Absolue skin feels and looks way better. Also, it’s great makeup base cream because it’s eliminated little skin flakes.  The texture and scent also really pleasant. Only I wish it came with a little spatula.',\n",

This beautifully textured cream is extremely hydrating and moisturizing and feels amazing on my skin. This cream melts into my skin, leaving it feeling so extraordinarily well nourished. It leaves my skin feeling so satiny smooth and so unbelievably soft and supple throughout the day/night. It is truly amazing how long the hydration lasts! Although most skincare products take time to see results, I noticed an immediate change in my skin after just one use. My skin definitely looks and feels healthier and the benefits keep increasing with each use (I’ve been using the cream for two weeks now). My fine lines have definitely lessened in appearance and my skin appears smoother and with a newfound luminosity. An absolutely amazing cream! I can’t say enough good things about it! Love. Love. Love. Additionally, the light scent is lovely and the jar is gorgeous. (I also really appreciate that you can purchase a refillable capsule, making the product more eco-friendly).',\n",
       " 'Wow wow wow. This moisturizer blew me away. My skin loved it. Very moisturizing and brightening. My texture looked smoother and there was a snap to the skin.

It has a luxurious texture and a light fragrance that I wish was not there but would still buy it.',\n",

I enjoy trying new skin care and this one was a big hit. I have sensitive skin, and this was non-irritating. My friends and family would certainly love this cream. The really nice thing about this product is a little goes a long way.',\n",
       " 'When I first opened the jar and smelt the strong rose scent I was initially concerned. It smells lovely, but some moisturizers with heavy fragrance can cause me to breakout, as I have sensitive skin. Luckily that was not the case at all - I’ve have had no issues with breakouts or irritations since using it for the past 2 weeks as my evening moisturizer. It feels great going on, super silky and gives my skin a nice soft glowy finish (thanks to the shea butter). Its a bit on the thicker side, which is also why I’ve been using it in the evening, but not too thick - it definitely hydrates and I’ve found my skin looking more ’awake’ and bright in the mornings. And finally I’ll just add - the jar it comes in is super luxe and cute :) a super nice addition to my skincare collection.',\n",

It did immediately soften and hydrate my skin!',\n",

       " 'I was incredibly skeptical of this product when I received it. I’ve not had good luck with nonskincare-specific brands. I have very sensitive, reactive skin, so I am very careful of what I put on it. It is very comparable to the La Mer soft cream in terms of feel and consistency — thick and melts into the skin. It smells heavily perfumed like rose, so if you are sensitive to fragrance I would stay away. My skin didn’t react to it, thankfully. I used it morning and night for 2 weeks and I felt like my skin definitely became smoother, softer and more even. I had less redness overall. It kept my face moisturized and comfortable even in winter weather and while being outside in the dryness for hours. I love this cream and I think it really works. The only con is the cost. It’s very expensive and you would get similar results with something cheaper.',\n",
       " 'First, I love the packaging. It feels and looks luxurious. The cream itself goes on like butter but it’s still a little thick. I did see some improvements with my skin after a week and a half of use. I stopped using all of the products I was using before and just used this and am still using it because it worked for me!',\n",
       " 'Lancome Absolue Soft Cream Revitalizing & Brightening Moisturizer is super light but creamy and it hydrates my skin without feeling greasy. I wasn’t sure that I would like the smell so I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed it. I look forward to moisturizing my face every day. I recommend this face cream I you can afford it.',\n",
       " '* I received this product as a free sample for an honest review. This cream felt super luxurious  and glided on my skin without feeling weighty, heavy or caky. After experiencing for 2 weeks have seen my skin appear firmer and brighter! This is a pricey cream but it goes a long way and shows results indicative so could be justified on return on investment',\n",
       " 'Great cream.   Makes my skin feel wonderful! Younger and fresher and brighter!',\n",
       " 'I really like how this made my skin feel. Sure a rich great cream.',\n",
       " 'This is a nice product, but was overall not a good fit for my sensitive, combination skin. I found the rose scent pretty, but not for a face product as it feels like wearing perfume on my nose. It is a unique texture which I liked for my winter dry patches, but would only use in the winter because t-zone gets too oily in the summer. I would like it more as a gel vs a crème.',\n",
       " 'This is a great lotion. It’s soaks into the skin and leaves it feeling so soft and hydrated. The scent is subtle and I don’t notice it lingering. I’ve noticed it leaves my skin glowing.',\n",
       " 'This has been a wonder addition to nightly routine. The cream is rich and velvety but absorbs quickly and doesn’t feel heavy or greasy. I love the way my skin looks and feels from using it. Soft and moisturized and glowing. I like that there’s no overwhelming scent as well.',\n",
       " 'This feels lux going on even without the container (which looks great on my beauty shelf). Soaks right into a smooth supple finish and unless most, I barely noticed the rose smell and definitely didn’t smell it once it was on. I like this tons more than La Mer’s soft cream as far as a face crea mwithout spf goes.',\n",
       " 'My wallet truly wishes I didn’t love this incredible cream, but alas. I do. This cream has a lovely, super delicate fragrance. The container is beyond luxurious. The texture is light and almost whipped, and absorbs so quickly. I’ve been using it nightly and can see such a difference in my skin’s moisture level. Late winter/early spring is a Bad Time for skin in the midwest...it’s still cold and dry, but this cream has kept my skin balanced and dewy. I have only used it for nighttime, but there’s no reason it couldn’t be used for day as well, layered under sunscreen.',\n",
       " 'This cream feels so luxurious and is absolutely perfect for my dry skin. I prefer using it in the PM since it goes on a bit thick (Neutrogena in the AM, but it’s way too light for PM). But by morning, it just absorbs into the skin so well, doesn’t feel greasy at all. I personally love fragrance in my moisturizers (I’m not allergic to fragrance) and this has a lovely floral fragrance. My skin is acne prone and I am very, very careful about adding new products to my routine and this did not break me out!!! My skin is definitely brighter (I use in conjunction with a glycolic serum and Sk II currently) - will need to use longer to gauge anti-aging benefits. On the pricey side, but I feel like this might last me for a few months - have to wait and see. Would absolutely recommend.',\n",
       " 'absolue-tly love this!  The cream is nice and thick, smells nice, and goes on in a way that feels hydrating.  It doesn’t just sit on your skin, you really feel it is absorbed and leaves your skin feeling lush into the morning.  I think that it is brightening as my skin always looks refreshed and supple after using this.  The anti aging factors are really hard for me to see, so I can’t really speak of that, but all over as a hydrating moisturizer this is a new go to for me.',\n",
       " 'Lancôme is a prestige brand, but this is a hefty price tag indeed. I’ve been using this Absolue cream for about 3 weeks now and it’s a lovely formula. It has a slight rose/flowery scent but isn’t overpowering nor long lasting. I’m a bit scent sensitive and it didn’t bother me at all. It feels a bit like a gel, and applies very smoothly. It absorbs fairly quickly and doesn’t leave you greasy, but very moisturized. I’ve used both under my makeup and as part of my nighttime routine. It helps my matte formula foundations stay smooth and actually helps the application process of those foundations stay better. Best part with my sensitive skin is that it doesn’t make me break out. As for long term effect, I can’t say for sure yet, but in 3 weeks I can say it has made a difference with how smooth and moisturized my face is. The packaging is great, gold glass jar with plastic lid and I love that it’s actually refillable. I can’t say for sure if this will be a repurchase yet because the price is offputting but I’ll know for sure when the jar is gone. This jar will last a long time because a little bit goes a loooooong way.',\n",
       " 'I received this a free sample and thought I’d give it a go. It does have an overwhelping rose smell when first applying. However this goes away quickily. I’ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and do not really notice much of a difference in terms of revitalizing and brightening, though my face does feel softer. While this product is not bad, I don’t think that I would buy another jar of this as I just do not see the results that this is aimed for on myself.',\n",
       " 'My face feels soft and baby smooth every morning. Very impressive results. I have used it for 10 days. It is very nourishing and hydrating. It feels lovely while applying. It keeps my skin moisturized all day long and it smells wonderful. faint smell not very strong',\n",
       " 'I have oily skin with enlarged pores and I loved how hydrating this cream was for my skin. However, I noticed that if I didn’t exfoliate or use toner, my pores would clog up. This is a very good moisturizer but keep an eye on your pores and use toner as part of your routine with this moisturizer.',\n",
       " 'I really like Lancome Absolue Soft Cream Revitalizing & Brightening Moisturizer.  The cream is packaged  beautifully and I love the golden color choice of the packaging.  I really like the texture of the cream, it’s soft and creamy and feels luxurious smoothing on my face.  The slight not overpowering scent is very pleasant as well.  I have been using Absolue Soft Cream Revitalizing & Brightening Moisturizer for a little over 2 weeks now and I am very pleased with the results I see on my face.  I have not typically seen results from other creams I have tried in the past so quickly.  So from this stand point I will say that I feel like Absolue Soft Cream Revitalizing & Brightening Moisturizer is a top notch product.  I feel like I am receiving multiply benefits from using Absolue Soft Cream Revitalizing & Brightening Moisturizer.  My skin is softer and feel hydrated and doesn’t appear tired looking like before.  I have never been able to shake that tired dull look using other facial creams in the past.  I feel like my facial skin is clearer which must come from the brighteners in the cream.  I received this product to test and review which I am happy to do so.  I will continue to purchase Absolue Soft Cream Revitalizing & Brightening Moisturizer after I use the jar I was given.  I really think that this is the facial product for me from now on.  I feel like anyone that tries Absolue Soft Cream Revitalizing & Brightening Moisturizer will feel the same as I do after using it for a couple of weeks.  It really has made a huge difference in how my facial skin looks and feels.  I am proud to give Absolue Soft Cream Revitalizing & Brightening Moisturizer a glowing review as the product only deserves this.  I would highly recommend this product to everyone.  But mostly to anyone that feels as if the facial skin has dullness and just needs a boost.  I feel like anyone that tries Absolue Soft Cream Revitalizing & Brightening Moisturizer by Lancome will be pleased',\n",
       " 'I received this product complementary from @Bzzagent and @Lancome in exchange for my honest review.  Lancome has knocked it out of the park with Absolue revitalizing brightening soft cream!  The packaging is exquisite and beautiful it instantly gives you a sense of luxury.  I’m so excited I was given the opportunity to try this product.  The cream is a light pink color that has an amazing scent, it’s a light rose fragrance that is absolutely perfect.  The cream is a thick rich consistency that is perfect for dry skin, it makes a lovely night cream.  Lancome’s Absolue is perfect for anytime use, it brightens and revitalizes your skin leaving you with a glowing youthful complexion.  I have noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin, my skin is more illuminating and brighter the texture of my skin has transformed into smooth soft and supple feel and appearance.  While this might be a bit pricey it’s definitely worth the price especially for dry, mature or damaged skin.  Lancome’s Absolue is also a wonderful option to use as it works amazing as a base for appling makeup.  I highly recommend this product!',\n",
       " 'I have been trying this Soft Cream for 10 days, and I do notice a more even complexion, and softening of fine lines now.  I’ve used it all ways both day and night: alone, after a serum, and under makeup, and find it delivers.  For me the smell is a subtle, rose smell which is not cloying at all.  I find it absorbs quickly so you can get on with your routine.  I would recommend it to those wishing for a great cream to hydrate and even out skin tone, and I’ll be looking into other Lancome Absolue products.',\n",
       " 'I am pleasantly surprised by the results of this cream. The feel is luxurious but also incredibly lightweight. The product absorbs quickly and leaves my skin hydrated for the whole day. I am seeing a bit of brightness in my areas of hyperpigmentation after 30 days so I am excited to see the results after long term use. A great choice for the upcoming spring and summer months.',\n",

My skin feels so much softer and is definitley brighter as well. I have tried many many creams but nothing compares to Lancome’s Absolue. I highly recommend this product.This Absolue cream is so top of the line and will be my go to night cream from now on!',\n",
       " 'I am 47 and struggle with combination skin, acne, rosacea and fine lines.  After 9 days using Absolue, my skin was radiant.  My co-workers even noticed a difference.  My skin was smooth, soft and my redness quelled.  Highly recommend',\n",
       " 'Luxurious cream. It’s very thick but fast absorbing. It literally applies like butter. My skin loved it.  After application, my skin is extremely soft and adequately nourished. I can’t tell you how much I love this cream. My skin has been glowing. I am pretty much obsessed!!! It’s a pricey cream, but this is a great product. It does wonders for your skin. I am in love.',\n",
       " 'I’ve been using Absolue morning and night for almost two weeks. I love how soft it is and the non Greasy formula. I was a bit worried that it would have a robust fragrance especially with Rose extracts. Smells very soft and pleasant. I noticed the brightness the first time I put it on, which surprised me. I’ve gone a Few days without putting makeup on since my skin looked radiant without it. On the days I did wear makeup, the cream was a great base which made the makeup go on easily. I recently moved to Denver where the air is dryer and this cream is a welcome blessing to keep my skin hydrated. I’m in my late 50’s with normal to dry skin. I’ve used Clinique and Olay In the past. I would recommend this product. I’m giving it 4 stars only do to the cost. It is expensive.',\n",
       " 'OK, this product is literally heaven in a bottle. I use it nightly and it feels amazing on my face, very soothing and very hydrating. I wake up with an extremely hydrated face every morning and it has definitely helped to soften the feel of my face and smooth out the texture.',\n",
       " 'I received this product three weeks ago and I’ve been using it every night after the shower on my face and neck. I love the light sent and I definitely see a difference and wake up hydrated. I have slightly sensitive skin and it hasn’t bothered me at all. I love this product and I’m definitely going to buy more when I run out.',\n",
       " 'The Lancome Absolue Revitalizing & Brightening Moisturizer is intensely hydrating to my mature and dry skin. It instantly plumps the skin and smooths the lines to make it a perfect canvas for my make up. I love the non greasy application and the light rose fragrance.This new night time application has immensely improved the texture of my skin and brightened my face with regular use over the last 2 weeks. I am very happy with this cream, if the price was a little more affordable....It would make me even more happier.',\n",

I have already noticed a subtle difference in the appearance of my wrinkles and my face definitely looks brighter. the formulation is creamy and very moisturizing. A small amount of product goes a long way. it smells great but not overpowering. i have used other lancome moisturizers and this is by far my favorite.',\n",
       " 'First off, I must say this is one of my favorite products in my skincare regime. Its extremely lightweight and feels so great on my skin! It does not leave a greasy residue and I have no problem with wearing this under my makeup. Some creams are so think, its builds up and clogs pores. Im very happy with this Absolue soft cream revitalizing & brightening moisturizer. I highly recommend it!',\n",
       " 'I’m on the fence about how I feel about this moisturizer. My skin has been ridiculously dry this winter so it’s hard to fully judge. I can say compared to other products my face and neck stay moisturized longer. I’m going to give it a better try once the temperatures warm up and it doesn’t have such harsh elements to go against. Feels silky to the touch, I’m looking forward to seeing what it can do in the spring.',\n",
       " 'Let me start by saying I was given this product free for review,  but my opinions are entirely my own. This is a beautiful moisturizer. It leaves a glow unlike anything I’ve ever used. I use tatcha silk cream as my regular moisturizer, and I didn’t think ever like anything better than that. Much to my dismay, I like this better.  It isn’t greasy, or filmy, yet it leaves the skin with a noticable luminously, Which is visible even under make up.  Foundation sits nicely on top of it and doesn’t move around. The thing that surprised me most is that it didn’t cause my acne prone skin to break out.Bottom line I only gave this product 4 starts because of the price. I do think it to be a bit excessive. That said, I would purchase the smaller size, as a little goes a long way.',\n",
       " 'I really, really, really love this cream.  It’s not one I would have initially thought to get; as someone with more mature skin (cough cough) I gravitate towards moisturizers with lots of snazzy anti-aging bells and whistles in the name.  But Lancôme Absolue is a reminder to me that sometimes simple is best.  It’s one of the best moisturizers I’ve ever used.  The texture is marvelous; thick and creamy on your fingers, but smooths over your skin so lightly and easily; my face absolutely drank it up.  I love the scent (so did my 11-year-old, who immediately asked to try a dab because “it smells so good“).  It gives my skin a nice glow, and best of all, my skin feels soft and hydrated all day long.  I use a small dab in the morning and one before bed and during my first week with it I forgot to use it one night and I could definitely feel the difference the next day; my skin was dry, while on the nights I applied Absolue I woke up to baby soft skin.  And, while the quality of the moisturizer is what I love most, I also confess I love the gold jar that holds it.  I feel like I’m pampering myself when I use Absolue, and that means I start my day feeling good both inside and out.  Marvelous product; I recommend to anyone who wants a moisturizer that makes your skin soft as silk.  Definitely going to be a part of my beauty regimen going forward.',\n",
       " 'I love using Lancome Absolute Soft Cream Revitalizing & Brightening Moisturizer. It helps my skin feel soft and refreshed. My skin looks smoother and brighter too. It has a great rose scent and it absorbs easily. It keeps my skin hydrated all day. It works great under makeup too.',\n",
       " 'This cream works wonders for me. The fine lines around my eyes are a lot less noticeable. I’ve definitely noticed that I’m using less foundation and concealer to hide flaws. This stuff is working as it says it does. I would definitely purchase this product and I highly recommend it!',\n",
       " 'Nice creamy texture that glides on and soaks effortlessly into my skin. My face is usually tight after a shower, and this keeps everything nice and moisturized. I’ve also noticed a difference in my overall appearance, things are definitely smoother. I also love the scent, to me it’s not overpowering but to some it may be. I think it has a subtle rose scent. Love this…if you want to pamper yourself or invest in your skin., this is a nice high quality product.',\n",
       " 'If you hate scented products this is not for you. I don’t mind the scent and absolutely love the texture of the cream. It goes on kinda thick but turns into a thinner product that’s easy to spread and absorbs well. My skin is super moisturized and soft.',\n",
       " 'Amazing luxurious. feels so hydrating and still light and soft.',\n",
       " 'This moisturizer is the best! In a few weeks my face is noticeably brighter, smoother and feels great. The smell is so good they should make a candle. It’s the perfect weight. Truly a must have moisturizer. Better than any others I have used in past 35 years.',\n",

And I will be buying this as gifts for family',\n",

It does not feel oily or heavy on the face. I have noticed an improvement in my skin in the past week when using this product.',\n",
       " 'I was pretty excited to try this Lancôme Absolue Cream. I love a good quality moisturizer. I’m always hesitant on trying certain ones though because I’m worried they will be too thick or greasy on my skin. This one here I will either wear during the day without makeup and the reason for that is because it feels a little heavier on my skin so I go light on the amount of product I use also. I do however enjoy using this more so during my skin care routine at night time for good hydration. My skin appearance overall looks more even toned, smoother, and sleeker. It feels softer too. A tip I would offer is to wear this at night if you tend to have oily skin because this kinda adds the shine and the product is super moisturizing that it lasts all night! It’s personal preference but I don’t want a glowy oily appearance throughout my day from a moisturizer. But I definitely love using it in my nighttime routine. The product ingredients and packaging is very high quality and I love I can get the refill for the jar itself when I run low! I will be repurchasing this!',\n",

It makes my cheeks so supple, smooth and glowing. And you need only it and nothing else except some sunscreen. At the end of the day the skin is still hydrated smooth and glowing without being greasy at all. While my forehead, nose and chin are oily, a thinner layer of the cream will still work nicely on these areas without clogging the pores. Just remember not to apply it on a bad day!',\n",

Finally, a product that keeps me from getting flaky while keeping the worst of the shine at bay. I stay hydrated and lightly glowy without irritation/whiteheads at the end of the day.Application wise, it does best on clean but not damp skin. I layer it on top of a toner (Calendula Toner, same brand) and under a thick cream moisturizer (Dr. Jart+ Ceramidin Cream). I also find that if you let it soak in for a moment, moisturizer applies on top much better. If you have especially dry skin around the eyes, I recommend applying this product after eye cream as the concentrates tend to migrate on to dryer skin.',\n",

After having a horrible breakout with the less expensive serum I went back to this one because I still had some left and within a week my skin was getting back to normal and was soft again. This serum is not super fragrant, light on your skin, and doesn’t irritate the skin either. It is perfect for right out of the shower or in the morning if you want to put it on before your makeup. It is a bit on the oily side, but honestly it has helped calm down my skin again and I’m so happy I went back to this. I wish it wasn’t as expensive, but I’m definitely going to be getting this again when I’m done the bottle because it smooths out the skin and helps fade the darker spots from acne scars. I find it also just feels nice and gives me a nice glow after putting it on.',\n",

I bought this product when I became interested in using a Gua Sha, but I didn’t realize all the good it would do for my skin after using it. My textured skin is completely smoothed out which makes my skin look more naturally glowy and supple. I apply this product once a day and although it is an oil, it does not feel greasy or gross. Definitely recommend!!',\n",
       " 'I have loved Kiehl’s for over 15 years, and recently added this concentrate to my daily skin repertoire. First I apply toner followed by serum, then this concentrate, then my moisturizer. Within days I noticed my skin looking less “tired“, and I find that my face doesn’t dry out as the day wears on. After application, my skin practically glows, and after the product is absorbed, there is no oily or slick appearance. My moisturizer absorbs beautifully on top of the concentrate.

The scent is strong and the changes in skin texture, glow and clarity of my skin were minimal.

The ingredient list seems legit for protecting against free radicals; the smell is a nice morning pick me up.

I found a sample so I could try it out first. Because there’s tamanu oil, I thought that the scent would be nutty. I hate the scent of tamanu oil. It also mentions sunflower oil and ginger so I was like, is it spicy it something? However, the Daily Reviving Concentrate is pleasantly citrus scented. I’d say it’s mostly lemon-y. No trace of peanut butter or related foods. The oil has a similar effect as the Midnight Recovery Concentrate. I expect you could probably use either one at any time during the day (don’t quote me on that). There are some oils in both that I’ve read can create damage when exposed to sun, so if it’s concerning to you I’d recommend looking that up. This oil mentions that it prevents damage from the sun so maybe it cancels itself out. I don’t know. I also need to educate myself on which order to use this with sunscreen. All that said, I love this almost as much as the Midnight Recovery Concentrate, which is to say A LOT. MRC is in my top 5 beauty products. Excited to be able to add a new one to the family!',\n",

I have normal to dry skin and on days that I’m dry, I don’t feel like this does anything magical or extra to help.

I usually waited about 3 minutes before applying sunscreen and makeup.  I’m a face oil fanatic and there are so many others that I want to try, but I will definitely purchase this one again.  It is an AMAZING value, especially considering how long it lasted.',\n",

I typically add sunscreen on top and then some tinted moisturizer and call it a day, and this helps make my skin look glowy and healthy all day, even in the winter. You need this product.',\n",

This oil has become a part of my daily morning routine. I look forward to this step most of all. I apply an essence, or hyaluronic acid to my face first, followed by this beautiful oil, followed by eye cream and my main moisturizer/spf for the day. This oil has such a satifying slip when applying and sinks in like a dream. My skin feels immediately soothed as well as energied. I’m sure this is due in part to the bright, gingery scent that I have grown to really look forward to each morning. This sinks in just a couple of short minutes and doesn’t affect my makeup application in the least. I’m buying the larger size today because I’ve gone through three or four of the small 1oz bottles, and I can tell my love affair is here to stay. It’s lovely and light, but incredibly effective and satisfying to use the way you want a part of your self-care routine to be. Enjoy!',\n",

I’ve been using this as well as the midnight concentrate for three years daily after my toner and essence and my moisturizer after and and it really hasn’t done anything for my face.

       " 'I’ve tried phasing this product out of my daily routine with other oils or just not using an oil. My skin is so dry, I’ve realized I need a daily oil. This product is irreplaceable and has become a permanent staple. I suppose skin care is worth the money when it actually makes a difference. It makes my skin hold onto hydration better, lessens fine lines, and improves texture. If you have dry chapped spots, this will get rid of them. Just remember it IS an oil and it will leave your skin greasy. If you can handle this, go for it! I consider it an unfortunate side effect of having very supple, moisturized skin.',\n",

My skin does feel nice after using this and you might be able to use this as a moisturizer (I layer this under a moisturizer with spf). Overall, this product is pretty and fun to use AND smells nice, but it doesn’t seem to do what it claims and it is expensive. If you want something that smells and feels good and adds some hydration, then this is good. I’m going to try and use this consistently to see if I see any improvements in my skin. I have it two stars because it is hydrating (I’m tempted to give it three stars because I love the packaging,smell, and feel of it on my skin but I think the price point for what it does is not worth it).',\n",

Plumper? I don’t really know. It just looks better. Significantly better. Undeniably better. My skin is like a desert in the winter. Dry patches on my cheeks make it annoying to find a foundation that won’t exacerbate the issue. I’ve had a lot fewer dry patches since I’ve started using this concentrate. It gives my moisturizer a boost, and I just look more luminous. I’m going to keep using and buying this.',\n",
       " 'I never review products, but this product is so great I wanted to share with everyone.  Lightly scented, non-greasy oil that makes my skin feel like silk.  The results last all day, even if I use foundation over the concentrate.  I am a believer!',\n",
       " 'I love this. I use with the the night version. They are both very good. A little product goes far. I would repurchase.',\n",
       " 'Love! Just ordered a full size bottle! I received a small trial size of this oil, so I had about one week’s worth in the bottle, and wow what a difference a week made! My skin was softer, more radiant and it didn’t feel greasy nor did I break out. I have oily skin and after experimenting with this product I discovered the trick to applying prior to putting on make up without the grease -- keep a bottle in the bathroom and apply immediately after showering when your skin is damp and supple. I found that when my skin was slightly damp, I used less product and it absorbed quicker. By the time I finished drying my hair, the oil had absorbed and I was able to apply makeup without any greasy residue.',\n",
       " 'During the colder months my skin is impossibly dry,flaky and a bit dark around the mouth area.My smile lines are pronounced and my skin looks lifeless and ashy.Nevermind trying to apply makeup-forget it.I search tirelessly and used products too numerous to count but with no real results.As I continued my search ,I was watching a video by Jamie Genevieve on YouTube where she sang the praises of this product-I bought and tried having nothing to lose at this point.No regrets,my skin no longer has issues with dryness,dullness,roughness ,my laugh lines have considerably decreased and this wonderful product continues to wow me.I really would like  Kiehl’s products to be sold in store at Sephora Lehigh Valley Mall .Pa.',\n",
       " 'This product pairs super well with the Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Concentrate. I would say it doesn’t work quite as well, but it still feels light and great on the skin. My only downside, is that my skin tends to already be on the oily side, and having this on during the day, sometimes I feel like my skin doesn’t “soak up“ all the oil once it’s applied. I do still use this, but not everyday!',\n",
       " 'After receiving this as a sample, I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks. A little goes a long way, however, I don’t see a significant difference in my skin while using it. It will leave skin softer, but most serums do. For fine lines/wrinkles, it fails to deliver. I’ve used actual natural serums before that have done wonders, but for the price and questionable ingredients in this, I wouldn’t purchase. If you’re just looking for a little added moisture to your regimen, this may work for you.',\n",
       " 'I’ve been using the product every morning for the past three weeks and have noticed some nice improvements to my skin. It looks like I am wearing highlighter when my face is actually completely bare!  I will just pat a few drops of this into my skin each morning after moisturizing. It absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave my combination skin feeling oily.',\n",
       " 'This oil is great for my morning routine. It is a blend of natural oils that smells and feels amazing on my skin that is so refreshing. It goes great under my makeup, and I get complements on how even my skin texture and tone are. My skin just looks so much more healthy with it. I have very oily skin, and this does not contribute to me being more oily or having breakouts.',\n",
       " 'Love it. It immediately makes your skin look less tired. It’s great under makeup as well.',\n",
       " 'Really like this product. I’m not sure if I’ve noticed that it has changed the overall quality of my skin, but it adds a really nice boost of hydration under my moisturizer during these cold and dry winter months and makes my skin look luminous.',\n",
       " 'I bought the midnight oil treatment and I decided to get this one too for day time I think both work the same way I really like it my skin looks flawless',\n",
       " 'I feel that this product works best when mixed into a moisturizer than alone, especially when I’m having dry skin days. When my skin is extremely dry to the point that it seems to be peeling or flaky, it’s hard to spread this product around when it’s not added to a moisturizer. I’m also unsure if it is good to use during the day for oily skin types. However, I plan to continue use and see what happens from there. I definitely love the smell as well as the softness this product gives my skin. I also see that it doesn’t clog my pores which I was worried it would or cause breakouts because it’s an oil, but I haven’t noticed anything like that so far. Hopefully that’ll stay the same, the only reason I wouldn’t rate this product 5/5 because I just can’t tell if it is good to use during the day on oily skin, my skin is rather oily even on dry days if that makes any sense, but anyway I’m unsure if it makes my skin look more oily or if it’s the same as always, but other than that it’s great, well and the price isn’t the best, but as many other serums you pay a lot for a small amount, but I do believe it’s worth it.',\n",
       " 'I’m rating this 4 stars not because it’s not effective but because I don’t agree this is suitable for daytime use for people with oily skin. My morning routine is to cleanse, apply daytime serum and moisturizer with BB cream. I replaced my serum with this oil and by midday my face looked like you could fry a piece of fish on it. I’ve applied this at night though and have awoken to radiant skin! Therefore I’d suggest if you have oily skin to refrain from using during the day.',\n",
       " 'Wow.  I received this as a sample with one of my purchases and within an hour of putting it on my face, I purchased the full size.  Mind you, I am on a budget and ONLY buy things that I really like, and $50 for something like this sounds like such a waste, but it’s not.  That’s how good this is.  It smells wonderful, leaves my skin glowing and moisturized. I have pretty dry skin in the winter and this is a great for morning when my skin is so dry.  I have used so much of my trail size bottle (I need to use it more sparingly but I love the way it makes my skin feel), that I will probably be done with that by the time my package ships.',\n",
       " 'Wonderful! My daily routine is not complete without it. I’ve been using this during the day and the nighttime recovery at night and my skin is improving! I love it. Would highly recommend',\n",

       " 'I used to have an aversion to oils. I thought they would make me break out and leave a terrible residue. Not this. My skin is clearer, less red, and looks healthy. It makes my makeup go on easier as well. It’s well worth the price and lasts forever. Definitely recommend',\n",
       " 'I use this product every morning along with with my argan oil and it gives my skin a pretty glow! it smells great (citrus-like) so it’s a nice pick me up to have in the morning. it is pretty light for me but i also have dry skin so using the argan oil with it it a great combo. i would definitely purchase this again and even though it is kind of expensive you only need one or two drops so it lasts a long while.',\n",
       " 'okay so I have been using this along with the nighttime serum from the same brand and I can tell you for sure that my skin texture has definitely improved. I work long 13-hour days and no matter what I used on my face my skin would look tired and rough-textured by the end of the day. I have good skin luckily but 13 hours in a dusty warehouse takes its toll daily. kiehls has a customer for life! I definitely see a difference in how smooth and bright my complexion is. no clogged pores either',\n",
       " 'it is very light on your skin, 3 drops is enough before you apply your moisturizer. It has a citrusy smell, like orange which makes you feel fresh in the morning. I end up with glowy, soft and refreshed skin every morning, I like it and I would purchase again!',\n",
       " 'i got this with the midnight recovery concentrate and I’m glad I did. they truly work in tandem and I dont think my skin would look as awesome without the other. its light even though its an oil and it absorbs quickly. makes my skin look gradient radiant.',\n",
       " 'Lightweight, fast absorbing, perfectly primes skin for easy application of foundation, and it smells so lovely. A must have staple in my morning routine!',\n",
       " 'I like this concentrate. I’ve been using it for about a month now. I don’t feel like it’s an absolute must have in my skincare routine but it does leave my skin looking very healthy and glowy. It is an oil so beware of you have oily skin. 2-3 drops of this goes a long way. I use it after my serum and before my moisturizer.',\n",
       " 'AMAZING PRODUCT! Perfect for nighttime and day wear, before my moisturizer. Makes skin feel healthy and never dry.',\n",
       " 'I use this serum for daytime and the midnight recovery before bed. It definitely wakes my skin up and mkes me look glowly. I do have to wait a little while for it to sink into my skin before applying makeup so if Im in a hurry, I have to skip it. But when I have time its definitely worth it.',\n",
       " 'After reading so many reviews, I decided to take a chance and purchased the small bottle without sampling it first. So glad I did, as it has pretty much brought my 55 year old facial skin back to a much younger place. Scars have started to fade, and my skin has a much more supple and glowing feel and look.I think I will wind up buying the super large bottle once this one runs out - if it ever does, a little bit goes a long way - and I use it on my face, neck and upper chest area - just 3 or so drops covers it all.',\n",
       " 'Absolutely love this product!',\n",
       " 'I’ve wanted to try something from Kiehl’s for a while after doing lots of research on what would work as a skin oil for for dry skin.  I wanted to feel moisturized but not greasy.  This does the trick.  The smell is amazing, like a sunny orange grove.  And it absorbs pretty well, though it does leave a film on my skin, but not in a bad way.  My skin looks bright, and healthy.  I absolutely love it.  I feel like it’s really helped with the tiredness that tends to befall a lot of us in our daily life.  This helps combat that.',\n",

       " 'I’ve been wanting to find something like this for a while and I’m happy that I finally did! I started using this every other night after washing my face for the first few weeks and gradually moved up to nightly applications. 2 pumps is the perfect amount to cover my face. I love how light this serum is and it doesn’t seem to have a scent! It goes on easily and doesn’t feel heavy. My skin color looks more uniform after using for several weeks! I’m super please with the reduction of spots!',\n",
       " 'I’ve been using this serum for a few weeks now and my results have been really positive so far. At first my skin did have to adjust to the serum and I experienced some dryness around my chin area.  after a few weeks what I did notice is that my older acne spots have started to turn a light pink shade. But I’ve also been breaking out a lot so new red splotchy marks have replaced the old ones. I’ll continue to use this serum in hopes that it will fade the new spots I’ve been getting lately.',\n",
       " 'It definitely took my skin a bit to get used to this serum. Made me kinda dry at first but once my skin got used to it, it got better! I’ve been using for about 3 weeks now and have definitely noticed a change in my discoloration! Of course you need more time to see greater results but so far so good',\n",
       " 'I love how strong this is. The instructions actually say to start with limited use and increase as your skin basically gets used to it. Tranexamic acid always helps to lighten my spots with continued use so I’m excited to see results.',\n",
       " 'The Paula’s Choice Clinical Discoloration Repair Serum has been a great addition to my daily routine! I have dry skin, so hydration is very important and this serum definitely provides that. Over the past few weeks, it has helped start to brighten my dark spots and leaves my skin looking smooth and bright. My skin is only a tiny bit sensitive to it and turns very slightly red after application, but it doesn’t burn or hurt and the redness goes away within a few minutes - so for that I would not recommend this to those with very sensitive skin. Otherwise, I definitely recommend this serum!',\n",
       " 'I have a few dark spots around my face and neck that resulted from picking at breakouts that I’ve been meaning to treat. I’ve used this serum consistently on them for 2 weeks now and while the difference is subtle, they definitely not as dark anymore. Also cool that this serum helps to prevent new dark spots while treating existing ones.',\n",

I have recently had a few breakouts that have left stubborn dark spots and the Discoloration Repair Serum has done wonders for my skin! After consistent use I can see and feel a difference in my dark spots and general skin discoloration. My skin tone has become more consistent is trouble areas like my chin and nose. And my skin has a brighter more vibrant complexion.',\n",
       " 'I stopped using this product because I thought it wasn’t doing anything for me. Well, I’m back for more because I can definitely see a difference now. It really helped the brightness in my skin and all the little discolorations are coming back. I also think it contributed to a nice moisturization in my skin that I can’t seem to get back either. Pricey for me, but it works.',\n",
       " 'Seriously this has to be  one of my favorite serums for correcting discoloration!! I primarily use it for acne scarring and noticed a difference within a few weeks of consistent use. My skin was brighter and even stubborn scars have faded away. I would suggest to use it consistently to get the results you want! (:',\n",
       " 'It definitely does prevent new (dark/deeper) discoloration from forming! The older hyperpigmentation is taking a longer time to fade but I do notice a very very small change. I also noticed how my skin is more hydrated, more even in tone and smoother. But it can cause irritation (my neck is not used to acids so as a result it is irritated esp post scratch). So be careful and follow instructions. Hopefully with continued use, it will do its magic on those stubborn dark spots.',\n",

I have only been using this for a couple of weeks, which isn’t really enough time to decide exactly what it does for me, but here’s the info I can share: I have dry skin, and it is winter, and I live in an extremely dry climate. Often in the winter my skin does not look its best—my skin does seem to be doing well right now for this time of year. (Not looking too red or too dull.) This serum plays well with my other skincare products and doesn’t irritate my skin.  I like layering it under a creamy moisturizer. It feels smooth and soothing going into my skin, and it absorbs almost instantaneously. I do think the overall tone of my skin has started to look a little more even.',\n",

I have combo, acne-prone skin so I have a lot of scarring from acne. I also have fair skin, so the scars appear pretty dark. Unfortunately because I had to submit this review within a short timeframe, I can’t speak to the effectiveness of this product since I’ve only been able to test it for about a week.

After using it my skin feels so smooth and appears brighter and has a more even skin tone. It does not leave a greasy or sticky residue but feels light on the skin. I love how this serum refreshed and improved the appearance of my skin even after the first time using it, as you can see in my before and after pictures.

I really appreciate that as it makes it FAR easier to compare the product to published studies. In a 2019 study, Desai et al used the exact levels of both tranexamic acid and niacinamide in their study as appears in this product (3% and 5%, respectively) and saw results on skin tone and hyperpigmentation over the course of 12 weeks. Note this may mean sticking with the product for that duration to see comparable results, but it’s always nice to find the studies backing up claims!I am writing this review sooner than 12 weeks, but I will comment on usage so far. The serum is lightweight and has a slightly cloudy appearance. It absorbs without feeling sticky, and has not caused any irritation. I appreciate that it is fragrance free and has no smell also. As mentioned above, I am excited for the ingredients combination, including the addition of bakuchiol which I have observed seems to help in smoothing my skin.Pleased with this brand and product so far!',\n",

So far, it is very promising.',\n",

It has a slight scent but not fragrance and nothing unpleasant. I really enjoy how it makes my face look brighter and reduces my dark spots. Also leaves me feeling soft. I actually really like my freckles so I hate to lighten them,  but I have 2 dark spots, one  on my cheek and one on the forehead area, so that’s where I apply this serum to.',\n",

In conjunction with using other serums that help lighten dark spots like vitamin c, AHAs, and retinol, I am convinced incorporating this into my skincare routine has lightened these two pesky sun spots on my cheek that were annoying me. I used to have to layer on more concealer or bb cream on the spots to cover them but now I need one layer to diffuse and cover them well. The key to this product and any other for the matter is to be consistent and GIVE IT TIME. Be good about exfoliation (not too much and not too little), serum usage, moisturizing, and sunscreen during the day, rain or shine.',\n",

For the last few days I’ve been using this serum right around my cheek area, upper lip, and on my forehead, that’s where my dark spots are more visible. So far this serum has not broken me out, and it applies really nicely, and it layers well too. It’s perfect for sensitive skin types like me. The serum’s consistency is light and spreadable, a little goes a long way.  I hope that with consistency, along with sun protection I continue to see some brightening results.',\n",

I really had to slather on the sunblock after using it.',\n",

I was super excited to try this product because if the claims and because I’ve heard so many great things about this brand. As of right now, 2 weeks into using this serum, I haven’t seen any drastic results other than the fact that the complexion does appear brighter. I really like how comfortable this feels on the skin. Its gentle and lightweight milky texture absorbs nicely. It’s working well layered with other serums too. It’s been gentle enough to use daily but I only use it at night, personal preference. I will finish the bottle and hopefully my dark spots will get lighter over time.',\n",
       " 'I recently ran out of Paula’s Choice 20% Niacinamide and the C Booster (both of which are excellent at lightening discoloration and didn’t break me out at all), and so the timing was perfect when I saw this new serum and decided to try it out instead of replacing those other two serums. Like other reviews mention, this is a lightweight feeling serum, absorbs quickly, does seem to work, but after trying it 3 times on clean skin and getting blemishes, I unfortunately have to return it. I’m not sure what made this product not work for me when the other two did, but in comparing the ingredients I did notice this one has a number of oils in it, which is an ingredient type I try to avoid as my skin can be acne-prone. Not sure if that’s what did it, this may work well for others, but as for me I’ll be returning it.',\n",

       " 'I had always heard of really great things about the brand and was glad to try a product which would help with the most challenging area of my skin-hyperpigmentation/discoloration. It is recommended to be used for 8-12 weeks for best results and I do see a certain light fading of darker areas on the chin and around the nose. I hope to see better results in more weeks. The consistency is not very thick and works well under a light moisturiser for me. Love the packaging. The ingredients Buckchoi and Niacinamide are the star contents.',\n",

Make sure to use at least an SPF 30+ when applying it. Definitely recommend!',\n",
       " 'This serum seems to be working pretty well. I have quite a bit of hyperpigmentation and uneven skin. I believe it’s going to take much longer to see some results as I have only been using it for about a week. I use it as part of my nighttime routine. It doesn’t have a distinct smell. The consistency is like a gel serum. I would recommend this serum for anyone suffering from discolored skin.',\n",

       " 'What a lovely formulation! I like the combination of ingredients with 3% tranexamic acid, 5% niacinamide, and 1% bakuchiol. I would at least use tranexamic acid and niacinamide in my routine anyways so this helps streamline my routine. I have not used it long enough to speak on the difference for dark spots, but I trust the ingredients, and the texture is very smooth and milky and nice. Minus one star though bc it is a lil expensive.',\n",

I typically use tranexamic acid  in a different product but that product also smells strongly of sulfur so I was looking for a product that has more of a lighter scent this one indeed has little to no scent and it is a gel-like consistently that is soothing and calming to the skin I love that the ingredient list also includes bakuchiol,  overall will rebuy this product',\n",
       " 'This is a nice serum. I like the texture and it layers well with my other skincare products. I’m not the biggest believer of bakuchiol but I do love me some tranexamic acid and niacinamide! It’s still to early to see if there had been any visible reduction in my dark spots because I haven’t been using the for that long(only been using for a week) Though I am sure it will do the job and in the mean time I’m enjoying how it feels',\n",

       " 'My skin is pretty normal but sensitive to fragrance & this didn’t irritate my skin in any way. I was gifted this for my honest review. I go in with my cleanser, toner, exfoliator and then this treatment & finally a moisturizer. If used in the daytime I apply a sunscreen of spf 35+ as my final step. The texture is very silky smooth, not thick at all. This made my skin look radiant, helped fade my dark spots on my cheeks and my skin felt very smooth. Try this 8-12 consistent weeks for best results.',\n",

The serum has a lightweight, almost liquidy consistency. It feels very smooth on the skin. I didn’t experience any irritation or sensitivity. It contains no fragrance or drying alcohols, making this a great option for those with sensitive skin. I didn’t notice any drastic brightening for my sun damage, but this is good for things like dark spots from acne. It also helped with improving skin texture. It’s quite pricey so I suggest waiting for a sale.',\n",

I have loved some of the makeup I have gotten from this brand, so I had very high hopes for this product. The packaging is beautiful and looked like it would protect the unstable Vitamin C inside. As was the case with many of the other reviews I have now read, when I finally received my online order, I found the serum was expired (the Vitamin C had oxidized and turned a dark brown color). I was soooooo disappointed, but I headed down to my local Sephora store (#570) to try and exchange it for one that had not expired. The staff was great, but unfortunately after going through every single one of these they had in store, the very helpful staff found that ALL OF THEIR STOCK WAS EXPIRED! Yikes... it doesn’t bode well for this product. I ended up getting a refund and I picked up Drunk Elephant’s C-Firma Day Serum. Paid a lot more for this, but I know that the ingredients in this one are what I was looking for and it was not expired, so that’s a plus! I gave Tarte’s serum two stars because it has potential if you could get one that is not expired, although I would worry about its longevity - but the price is very good!',\n",

No brightening, increases smoothness, nothing, and here’s why that is to be expected: this product contains both ascorbic acid (vitamin c) and glycolic acid, both are great to include in your skincare routine but they need to be used SEPARATELY! Although it is safe to combine them, they are substantially less EFFECTIVE TOGETHER! When combined the pH of the acids is changed reducing their effectiveness. That’s why it is recommended to use vitamin c in the am and glycolic acid or another AHA at night to get the most out of the products you are using. Any product formulator would know/understand this! What is the point of wasting money on a product if it doesn’t work? That’s like throwing money away! I want my products to work and work well!

I see almost instant brightening results as well as smoothing of fine lines and wrinkles!!I see some comments about oxidation... mine was fine and the product has been bright orange the entire time of using. The 30ml bottle is sealed with a pump on the top so oxygen cannot get to the product, not sure about the mini size though. When applying, it does have a penny (copper) like smell to it and it is a little sticky but the smell almost instantly goes away and it saturates and dries smooth.

I’ve had a lot of tough acne scars which weren’t fading away but this definitely made them a lot lighter.

Vitamin C serum usually gives me a glow. This does nothing. It has oxidized and it’s worthless.',\n",

This expired way before it should have, and using oxidized vitamin C can actually damage your skin.  I will never buy this from Sephora again.

Pros are it doesn’t break me out or cause sensitivity/redness, it’s not too oily feeling for my very oily skin, easy to apply, love the container with dispenser, I prefer that to droppers. The only con is I can’t tell if it is actually making much of a difference or not, and I’ve used it for about a month. I am trying something else after I finish this.',\n",

I’m 50 years old now and in those years topical vitamin E has been the major cause of my acne and sensitivity.  Back to the product: After two  weeks of everyday use I’ve noticed considerable fading of my discolored areas and and overall evenness to my skin tone.  Like most vitamin C’s it’s a bit sticky at first but that quickly disappears after which there’s zero feeling of any kind.  5 stars, easy.',\n",

It’s a great price and I actually don’t find the scent very strong at all.',\n",

I bought this one out of curiosity and was slightly disappointed my first couple uses, as my skin broke out and was a bit irritated. But I stuck it out a couple more days and now I am on my third bottle. It is the best Vit.C serum I have used and a definately notice a difference in my skin. My skin isn’t as dull as it was, it has brightened and smile lines are less visible. I noticed a difference after the first couple weeks and it is way more affordable than others, which aren’t half as good. It is now a permanent part of my skin care routine. I really rely on reviews to guide me in my purchases here and thought I should take the time to write something as it is a really nice product.',\n",

It doesn’t smell like much when you put it on but after rubbing it on with my hands, I cannot get the smell out of my hands, even washing my hands multiple times. I don’t put it anywhere near my nose because of the smell. I’m going to keep using it but suggest if the smell bothers you, to use as little as possible.',\n",
       " 'Since Tarte Knockout is one of my holy grails I thought I would try some of their other skin care. I actually like a thicker Vit C serum with some tact to it and this defiantly fits that bill. Wears well under makeup but looks beautiful and lasts all day on a bare face. Price is kinda step, results are on par with any other decent Vit C serum. I’ve had Vit C serums that deliver a smidge better results but because I like the consistency of this one and it looks so good on bare skin this is what I indeed to repurchase.',\n",
       " 'This is my first skincare purchase from Tarte (picked it up on a whim in store) and I’m liking the results. I have super sensitive skin and use this every second night and have had no breakouts or redness. It helps even out my skin tone (less concealer required!) and my skin definitely feels smoother in the morning. I docked one star because the smell is quite repulsive and lingers for hours, and because the moisture and glow doesn’t last as long as I would’ve hoped.',\n",
       " 'I love this! Very light going on and easily absorbed allowing me to layer on my sunscreen and then makeup without feeling heavy. And it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin! The formula is similar in feeling to Drunk Elephant’s Vitamin C product.',\n",
       " 'I initially purchased the mini size of this product, being a bit hesitant to dive in on the full size. I’ve used many Vit C serums from Drunk Elephant to Ole Henrikson to Sunday Riley and Tarte did not disappoint! I love that the Youth or Dare Serum includes both Vit C and Acids. It did not irritate or breakout my sensitive skin. The smell is not wonderful, but it’s a Vitamin C and Acid Serum so it is expected. The smell resembles the products that make up the formula, similar to Tarte’s Knockout but much less potent. This serum glides on smoothly and works well with my other skin care products. Overall I am very impressed with Tarte’s Youth or Dare Serum. For reference I am 41 yo with sensitive combo skin.',\n",

It smells like super glue or something like that. And second, I don’t feel like it ever absorbed properly. I applied it on a clean face, prior to my moisturizer. It left a very sticky feeling. I even tried to wait a little longer after application before applying moisturizer, and it didn’t make a difference. Just feels sticky. So with combination of the gross smell and sticky feeling, it wasn’t worth it at all. I returned it.',\n",

While I did not see a big difference in my skin, I do feel like it was a hydrating serum and my skin does feel smooth when I’m using it. I find it to be a great product to use on the nights I’m not using more intensive exfoliating products. It does leave a sticky feeling at first but as soon as I put my moisturizer over it, the stickiness completely goes away. I would recommend to those in their 20s',\n",
       " 'I’m going to split the difference here! :) I really wanted to love this as I love everything tarte. However. I found it to be sticky and smelled... funky. Not bad, just off. I didn’t notice a huge difference in my skin after several weeks of use. So, 3 stars for me. That said. My husband? He really liked it and there was a noticeable change in his skin! 5 stars from him.',\n",
       " 'I used this product every day for 31 days and found that it dramatically made my skin brighter, with some good effects seen on the tightness of my face. Small fine lines in my forehead were plumped and no longer noticeable with daily use. The product does have an orange smell to it - it’s not overly powerful. I only used this at night before bed (after cleansing) because it didn’t really absorb too well into my skin and felt very sticky/tacky. I’m not sure how makeup would look overtop of this product. My mother (51) tried this product out for the same length of time and she had even more noticable results and will continue to purchase. I won’t be purchasing again but this was certainly a good trial for me. I recommend if you’re of older age or if you have more advanced aging skin due to sun exposure.',\n",

       " 'I used the serum every night for 30 days. The serum has not broken me out. My skin does seem a little bit brighter, reduced some redness, and made my face feel smoother. My face is not as oily as before, which I love. The smell does not bother me. It did leave my face with a sticky feeling after applying. It would dry down but, it took a while. I shook the bottle and would apply 1 pump nightly. I stopped using my toner. Overall I do love the product. I will switch using it every other night so I can use my toner. I wish it would absorb into my skin quicker.',\n",

       " 'I love this stuff. It really reduces my redness, evens out my skin tone and gives me a glow. My breakouts have reduced drastically but I still do get a zit or two from time to time and it’s a little bit sticky. Overall my skin loves this serum.',\n",
       " 'Love this serum. I have tried many vitamin c serums but none of them checked all the boxes. A lot of the vitamin c serums on the market are either too sticky, too oily, or in moisturizer form. Tarte youth or dare are none of those. It absorbed into my skin quickly, didn’t leave a sticky/oily residue, worked perfectly under SPF and makeup, and most importantly, made a difference in my skin. I had purchased it to help lighten some post inflammation hyperpigmentation (aka some big cystic zit scarring) and was pleasantly surprised by how quickly they lightened after I started using this serum. The other parts of my face are also noticably smoother and even.The main gripe I have with the product is that tarte has decided to tint the serum an orange color so people won’t notice when it has gone off. L ascorbic acid is the most proven effective form of vitamin c (which is part of why I like this serum), but is also known to be unstable and will expire quickly. I’d rather be able to tell when the serum is starting to go off so I can use it up sooner. I also like that the packaging is in pump form to limit air exposure and that it is opaque to limit light exposure. I just wish there was a way to tell how much product is left in the bottle.',\n",
       " 'So I just got into Tarte and I’ve purchased their “Foundcealer“ and I absolutely love it. I wanted to really like this product but for starters, the smell was not appealing at all. I also did not see an improvement in my skin after 2 weeks of continuous use. Did not work for me, I have combination skin and I’m in my late 40’s.',\n",
       " 'I didn’t realize when I bought it that this serum is an aha along with vitamin c.  It is great and works really well. The packaging is pretty and it has probably the best pump I’ve used. I didn’t notice any dark spots or blemishes fading, but my skin looked so much brighter. The only reason I can’t give this 5 stars is because of the smell. I haven’t seen any other reviews say anything about a smell, but the one I bought smells awful! It smells almost chemical/metallic. My hands would smell even after I washed my hands and I had to wait at least 6-10 minutes before I could use my moisturizer or else the scent would be even worse! Could just be the one I received, but I can’t get past it. I’ll be returning it.',\n",
       " 'Very hydrating, but I don’t see the vitamin c or glycolic benefits. My skin isn’t brighter, my hyperpigmentation isn’t better and my pores don’t seem to be getting smaller. I do like it because of how hydrating to my dry skin it is though with the hyloronic acid.',\n",
       " 'I really liked this serum. It helped brighten my skin and bring it back to normal when I felt like it needed a pick me up. Does have a tacky feeling on the skin but I find it comparable to other serums I have used and I used it at night so it didn’t bother me. It has brightening, hydrating and exfoliating properties which is great because those are the three things I want to do before bed in one step. I did find it helpful to rinse off my face in the morning because it was an exfoliant',\n",
       " 'I love this serum, it has brightened my skin while reducing acne and pores. But a quick note to girls with acne, you will break out for a week or more until your skin gets used to it.',\n",
       " 'I was looking to add some Vitamin C to my routine, and I really like a lot of Tarte products. I have normal/combo skin that tends toward oily, and most of the Vit C I’ve tried makes my makeup slide around my face. I’ve only used this at night, to try to avoid that issue, and I really like how my skin looks and feels the next day- brighter, more even- but this doesn’t ever really dry down for me. No matter how little I use, if I sleep on my side, I find myself having to literally peel my face off of my pillow. This stuff stays tacky for hours. I like the pump, the price, and what it does for my skin but I probably won’t repurchase because I find myself reaching for other products because I don’t like how sticky my face is when I use it.',\n",
       " 'I used this serum consistently for 30 days in my Tarte Youth or Dare challenge. I have been applying at night after I have washed my face and then let it dry. The next morning, I make sure that I use SPF. I do agree with others that it does leave a stickiness and if I am not careful a orange tint on my hands the next day. I noticed a brighter complexion and a tightness feel to my face after use. However I havent noticed much more change than that.',\n",
       " 'Not too sure what is in this, but it’s working wonders on my acne prone oil slick of a face. I normally get really bad hormonal acne during that time of the month. And this month, NOT ONE FREAKING BREAKOUT. It dries pretty quickly, and leaves my skin feeling dry (for me that’s awesome) and I use a hydrating primer in the AM and Kiehls face cream at night. My skin feels softer, more vibrant, and my tone is much more even. I’m not a fan of the tarts makeup, but the skin care is on pointe!!!',\n",

My redness has been reduced to a point where I am comfortable wearing just a lighter bb cream. My pores are shrinking by the day and my skin has never felt so soft. I find makeup is going on much easier and my skin over all is more even. This is going to be a holy grail for me! I love that this serum does not leave my skin feeling oily or saturated.',\n",
       " 'Initial impressions reminded me of the drunk elephant c firma serum. Similar consistency, scent, and application. Looking at the ingredients this is definitely not a product for sensitive skin as it has both vitamin C along with AHAs. After using it for a few weeks I think that it has considerably smoothed and brightened my skin. Be sure to use with spf if using as a day serum as AHAs make your skin more sensitive to sun. Also make sure to moisturize well as this serum can by drying if your skin is sensitive. Overall I think that it performs just as well as priceir alternatives like the truth serum fro ole henriksen and the c firma serum from drunk elephant. If you’re looking for a potent vitamin c serum then this one should do the trick as long as you’re willing to moisturize properly and put on your daily spf.',\n",

I noticed that the wrinkles on my forehead look better and my skin tone has evened out, I’m not as red. Also, my skin has become softer. My pores did get bigger since I stopped Knockout during the 30 days, so I’m interested to see what happens when I switch between the two. I did not like the smell, but I only noticed it when I first put it on.',\n",

I also am not crazy about the sticky feeling before it dries. I used it at night and used mermaid skin and h20 in the morning before putting on makeup. I am seeing reduction of my fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead. Plus my skin is much more even and smooth. I also feel like my complexion is a lot brighter.',\n",

It has helped with smoothing out the overall texture of my skin as well as making fine lines not as noticeable!

This at night with a nice thick night cream... oh my gosh, a recipe for perfect skin. I will say that due to the acids in it, if you have any sensitive patches on your face this will irritate it. If you have quite sensitive skin, buy with caution. Other than that... You. Need. This. Serum.',\n",

Nor did it brighten my skin in any way.Good thing is there’s no funky scent, which I appreciate very much. I don’t hate it, it’s just not as effective as I’d hope.I’ll use it up, but won’t re purchase it. Too expensive without results. (FYI, I have mature skin, 47 years old)',\n",

My skin is sensitive but it can handle harsh acids so didn’t have any irritation from this product.  There is no weird smell and does not sit on the skin, it is a fantastic product and so glad I found it.

Only, I thought, doesn’t pure Ascorbic Acid destabilize in water environment (water is the first ingredient here)? Oh well, maybe they found a way... After actually using this serum for several days, I was left underwhelmed. Can’t even attest to its effectiveness, simply because it pilled under makeup for me, so it won’t work for my intended purpose. Did it oxidize? Possibly. How ironic.',\n",

I’ve been using this product for about a week now and after just a few days noticed how super soft, smooth, supple and even my face looks and feels. I’m using far less moisturizer, my face is clear and I won’t even consider using my harsh exfoliant wipes, I don’t need them!

Now I have to get my skin back to the way it was...i really enjoyed this though before I started breaking out....if u can tolerate Vit C and don’t break out Easy this is a great serum. It’s lightweight, non greasy, no heavy fragrance ...come in an enclosed container so the vitamins don’t oxidize and lose its potency and a great price point for what ur getting. I’m so sad I can’t use it:(',\n",

It’s been about 9 days of using it and I can honestly say my skin looks so much brighter and full of life. It helped reduce some of my redness and hasn’t effected the way my makeup goes on.

The packaging says “.... p.s. I’m potent, not pungent” but I find the scent rather off-putting. I can’t describe the scent, but it smells a little too strong and chemically for me. I also wish that the bottle itself had a clear section so I could easily gauge when I’m getting low, rather than guess.

I have been using it every night for a week and noticed a change after the first use. My skin is less red, pimples are smaller, skin is so smooth and soft, more moisturized, radiant/glowy and dry patches are almost gone! My makeup goes on smoothly too. I feel like a whole new me!

I had been using Ole Henricksen’s Truth Serum, but it’s very gradual and pills under makeup.  I’ve only used the Youth or Dare serum a few times, but I already notice that the dark spot on my cheek is starting to fade.  It’s also a lot less expensive, and I love that the packaging completely blocks out air and sunlight.

I’m afraid it’s going to run out really quickly because it is quite small, so that’s why the 4 stars. It makes my face feel really nice when I wake up though and combined with the moisturizer I may have found my winning combination! I slightly broke out after starting both and I’m hoping it’s just my face getting accustomed to new products.',\n",

The clinique serum has been pretty much the only thing to finally stop those breakouts in their tracks. Whenever I run out of this I quickly notice new breakouts and the texture of my skin isn’t as smooth. Recently, I tried switching around my skincare routine and my skin broke out horribly. I just started using the clinique serum again a few days ago and my breakouts are already healing and I haven’t noticed any new pimples come up. Typically, I use this at night, after a glycolic acid toner and before a light moisturizer...but this is lovely used in place of a day time moisturizer during the warmer months as well, or if you have dry skin. I can’t speak for how well it does with wrinkles but if you suffer from hormonal breakouts or texture due to congestion I implore you to try this!!! I pray Clinique never stops making it. I just took one star off because I feel like I run out of it quickly (I need two pumps to cover my face). However, the results make it worth it, to me, to shell out the money',\n",

In the morning I use Repairware Lazer Serum as it’s really lightweight and less time for me to wait to add my moisturizer.  The reason I do like the Turnaround one is that it makes my skin feel soft in the morning when I wake up.  I’m not sure about the glow part but I think it does.  I use Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief as my moisturizer over it.  So I think the combination of those two products make my skin feel good. I have n/o skin with a few llines around my mouth. Oh well, I’m 71.  What do you want?  I’ll never have skin like a 20 year old again and I don’t expect to.  I just want to stop time now (unrealistic? yes but one can always hope).

Great for any type of day, wether wearing any makeup or not.',\n",

Honestly I don’t know about the glow..but I use it after my face oil and it’s just amazing. It makes my skin feel silky smooth instantly. I know this is mostly from the silicone but after using it twice a day for half a month, I can feel an improvement in my skin texture.',\n",
       " 'I used this serum along with the turnaround overnight moisturizer and MAN, this stuff has been like bootcamp for my face. I have combination/oily skin and have the occasional breakouts, and normally wouldn’t have chosen this type of treatment for my skin. The texture of this really is silky, it almost feels like some primers because of the “slip factor“ it has. While I initially felt like that just made my face greasy, it ended up helping my moisturizer go on smoother and I didn’t have to use as much of it. The slippery feeling stays for a few minutes, so it’s best to apply this (along with a moisturizer) pretty quickly after washing your face, but it will sink it pretty completely. I use a quick toner mist like the Caudalie beauty elixir to cut down that absorption time if I’m in a rush to put my makeup on and it seems to work the same. Now, since I’ve been using both the turnaround serum and moisturizer, I’m not sure which product to attribute my TOTALLY clear skin to, but I honestly have a more even complexion and noticeably smaller pores around my nose - something I’ve always thought was impossible and thus just a marketing hoax. The best part about all this, is that it’s been one long, gradual improvement. Once my skin started clearing up I got very few, if any, new breakouts and the dark spots from the old ones quickly faded. I never thought I’d be gushing about this, but my skin is just so uniform! The turnaround system really got me in line.',\n",

Don’t know how but they just keep getting better and better.I use this serum during the day and occasionally at night.It’s scent is very pleasing to me and this is not always the case with this kind of product.I really like that it is not oily so it does not interfere with my makeup, in fact it sort of helps when I put it on.When I look in the mirror I can really see and enjoy the results. My skin seems to have come back to life, truly renewed.',\n",

I have had issues with serums where they do not absorb in to the skin well, but this absorbs within seconds. Highly recommend!!',\n",
       " 'I’ve been using this for a little less than 2 weeks and I’ve already noticed a difference in my skin. The tone is noticably more even and my usual red patches seem less noticable. It even helped to get rid of a small but very stubborn break out I’d been struggling with for a few weeks, along with my usual spot treatment and acne face washes. Overall I recommend this product for anyone who has minor issues with dullness and skin tone evenness. It’s not a miracle product, but it definitely helps a lot.',\n",

       " 'I am 31 with no fine lines but hormonal acne on my cheeks and jawline. This serum did give me brighter and smoother skin, but it did not clear up any acne. I know it is not marketed to clear acne, but it is a chemical exfoliant with salicylic acid. It did seem to shorten the healing time of breakouts.When I finally can get my acne problems to clear up, I will use this serum again. It feels so velvety on the skin!',\n",
       " 'I liked the free sample and purchased a larger size. Used this serum twice a day and in about six weeks, noticed my skin actually looked and felt smoother. On my dry skin, this works better than anything I’ve tried in the last 10 years.',\n",
       " 'I have been trying out a lot of Clinique skin products lately and I have to say I absolutely love this serum, it may be my favorite product of theirs and that is saying a lot. I really do feel like it has improved my skins texture and my skin just looks younger and healthier in the short time I’ve been using it. I catch myself caressing my own face in awe of how much younger and smoother it feels now. Definitely recommend this product. I wear it at night and put the matching moisturizer on after the serum absorbs.',\n",

Its hard for me to squirt out the right amount. Hard to push down, and I either squirt out too much or too little. Can’t wait for my brand to come back in stock.',\n",

I have used 3 or 4 bottles (I try to buy the larger size 1.7 oz from nordstrom because it’s a slightly better deal. Really hope Sephora would carry a larger size!)My skin has been changing in the last year due to pregnancy and nursing, but in general I have normal skin with some sensitivity and prone to break out sometimes. This has been great for prevention. I have only had ONE real zit in the last 10 months, and it was hormonal.It ’s also really gentle, and fragrance free! Really helps smooth my skin.',\n",

I’m not sure why I stopped using it, but this summer my skin has been acting up, suddenly showing fine lines and breaking out. I bought this, and have noticed a significant improvement in the past few weeks. My skin glows. The texture is also perfect under makeup',\n",

Wanting to switch things up, I added this to my routine and I was completely surprised. My skin completely changed for the better. The texture got better, evened slightly and my skin glowed!

Used day and night, my skin is indeed dramatically improved - specifically with uneven skin tone and acne scars. Once a day does not seem to be enough to maintain the effects, so I go through a ton of this serum, but find it totally worth the cost. Best of all, the serum is fairly hydrating. I only need pair with dramatically different gel on my cheeks, and I’m good to go to sleep. In the daytime, I never use it without sunscreen.',\n",

I use this product daily In the AM under an SPF 50 tinted zinc sunblock (and glycolic acid + retinol treatment by PTRoth every PM). This routine keeps my skin smooth and baby soft. I also use boscia night cream in PM and AM. My face is not showing my age.',\n",
       " 'I purchased this serum because I have super combination skin (oily nose and forehead dry, flakey cheeks) and I was hoping that it would even things out for me a bit. This serum eradicated the dry, flakey patches on my cheeks, but it also gave me terrible blackheads (aka clogged my pores) all over my forehead, nose, and chin. Another reviewer commented that she thought that this serum contained a fair amount of silica, and I am now suspecting the same thing. I wouldn’t buy this product again.',\n",
       " 'As far as I am concerned, this is the best product that Clinique has ever made. I have used Turnaround Concentrate Radiance Renewer for years and I can attest that it does exactly what they say it does. I use it every night and my skin looks and feels smooth and younger looking. Best of all - people think I am younger than I really am :). I definitely recommend this one ladies - it works!!',\n",
       " 'I was recommended to use this turnaround concentrate, after using the ’CLINIQUE Acne Solutions Clear Skin System Starter Kit’ left my skin feeling dry.

If you are looking for something that keeps your skin feeling restored and glowing within a few days, this product is recommended.',\n",
       " 'It is a subtle change you will not see at first. I have used it once at night for 3-4 weeks. A few days ago I noticed my skin just simply looked generally better in the morning - hydrated, less splotchy, few breakouts. I’ve noticed smaller pores on my forehead, cheeks, and chin. Hasn’t worked as much on the sebaceous pores on and around my nose. One pump is enough for a full-face application. Definitely entering my routine.',\n",

My skin was pretty bad since I wasn’t using my normal skincare routine and the minute I started using this and adjusting my skin back to a steady routine, the change was noticeable. This product made my skin even, soft and clear. I love how it glides on and helps my moisturizer soak in. I will never go without this serum again!',\n",

This with my dramatically different moisturizing gel (daytime) and with my radiance overnight cream has done wonders with my skin.I don’t have the worst skin, normally have one or two zits most of the time - more so around that time of month. But since I have started using this serum (previously was only using the two moisturizers) my skin has never been so clear! I have been using it for about a month now and am SO happy with the results. New Holy Grail! :)',\n",
       " 'First i saw the product, it feels good and smells okay. However, when i applied it on my face, it feels that my skin so smooth which is not the normal smooth. so i think this product may contains much silica in it, which can make skin feels smoother. And after i apply it on my face, i have break out on my forehead. hense i hardly use it. now i use it as a primer because i think if i use it as a concentrate, my skin will not breath well.',\n",

Typically my skin is okay, not perfect, a handful of pimples, but not bad, so i can get away with it while I look for something I love. Two months ago my skin exploded in reaction to a new medication. Worst zits of my life; they hurt down to the bone and were angry and red. Nothing solved it. I was at my wits end. I switched medication again and while I stopped getting new breakouts, the old ones wouldn’t go away. I have been using this for a couple weeks now and almost all the breakouts are gone. I may never switch serums again.',\n",

This was the first product I tried and I’m addicted to it - it makes my skin so soft and so bright. I started using it over the summer and have received tons of compliments on my skin since.',\n",

I find that I don’t need primer when I put foundation on right after this product. No breakouts either. Great product!',\n",

I was standing at a Clinique counter bare-faced one day and said to a customer whom the clerk was trying to convince, “I’m 42“; both the clerk and the customer gasped, but I think it was evidence that Turnaround Cream WORKS.',\n",
       " 'I absolutely adore Clinique’s Turnaround Concentrate Radiance Renewer. Putting it on feels like pure silk on my skin, and using it under the Turnaround Night Moisturizer only intensifies the results. My skin instantly looked brighter and more even. I used to feel like I needed a bb cream (at the very least) every day to even out my skin tone, but now I don’t even have to wear makeup! Thank you Clinique!',\n",
       " 'I have used this for years before Clinique changed the formula. My skin was glowing and felt like velvet. I got compliments all the time! Fine lines were less visible, too. The newer version that has been around the last 2 years is terrible. It doesn’t absorb, feels goopy, and doesn’t deliver the effects it used to. The wording on the packaging is different too, as is the bottle as another reviewer stated (it being opaque, you can’t see the product). I wish Clinique would bring back the old formula!',\n",
       " 'I started using this about 6 months ago, and I’m just finishing the bottle. I saw absolutely no difference in my skin, so I won’t be buying this again. All the serums I have used in the past have had at least one positive effect on my skin, such as fading the dark spots in my skin, or making it softer or brighter. Unfortunately, this yielded no results whatsoever.',\n",
       " 'I used this product for years. I have often been complimented on my complexion- took it on faith that clinique was performing as promised. However, I no longer perceive the same effects. The product used to be referred to as an “exfoliant“. Is it?And, unlike previous containers over the years the newer container is opaque! You can not gauge the amount in the bottle. This small amount of expensive product should deliver on its promise to the buyer.',\n",
       " 'This is my third order. I tend towards dryish skin and this makes my skin really dry. My routine is undereye cream, this product, sun screen then foundation. Now i have to add another layer of moisturizer to avoid my face looking and feeling too dry. Not sure it is worth the payoff.',\n",
       " 'I’m not exactly sure what this has specifically done for my skin, but I love it! It’s a huge plus that it is oil-free (most serums are not) which is the main reason I ended up purchasing. I have acne prone skin and this has not caused any breakouts. I use at night and feel I wake up with glowing skin. It goes on very smooth, so I let it sink in then put a layer of Moisture Extend Clinique lotion on top. No dryness or tightness- just beautiful skin to wake up to!',\n",
       " 'I loved the old formulation of Turnaround Concentrate, but this new one just doesn’t seem to work the same for me. It sits on top of my skin and doesn’t absorb, making my face feel slick and oily. I’ve tried using it just at night to see if it absorbs better, but no luck. Sorry Clinique, not impressed with this product.',\n",
       " 'I tried this product because I was tired of my skin not having the youthful look it once had. I was a little skeptical at first and was skeptical about spending so much on a product. However, I am amazed at the overnight results. After the first night, my skin felt so soft and smooth and it is starting to regain the glow it once had. I am now sold as a Clinique customer. However, I wish they would go down on the price.',\n",

As a result, my skin looks smooth and I have less wrinkles than many of my friends of the same age. It is an oil-free serum, so it does not feel greasy or clog my pores. I think it is a great product.',\n",

       " 'these past 8 months I’ve had the worst acne. if you look up severe cases of acne photographs, i looked like that. it was horrible. finally, through mostly natural remedies I am pimple-less; however, im left with very red dark acne scars. I know that there’s a clinique product that’s more geared towards this problem, Even Better Dark Spot Corrector, but my mom had the older version of turnaround so I finished the 2nd half of that bottle and recently bought this newer one.I don’t know if it’s because my scars are relatively new (from 8 months to 1 month old) but this concentrate has already given me noticeable results in just 2 weeks without makeup I still look like I have pimples (even though theyre scars), but I don’t have to cake on green primer, foundation, and concealer anymore. I can get away with a super lightweight water-based bb cream and a dab of concealer. this is super helpful now that summer is on it’s way.even before i had acne i used to have a weird complexion but this product fixed that in like a day. amazing.i have a sample of the even better dark spot corrector so im going to try that on the acne scar spots, but i will continue to use this all over my face.note: can be used on current pimples, even kind of helps them a bit. use right after washing, let it soak in, then use moisturizer.to people with acne scars (especially young people who feel that this product is too expensive for their budget): this product is obviously more expensive than skin evening moisturizers or whatever you can get at a drugstore but i think in the long run you’ll spend less money on makeup and trial and error. also when you’re older you’ll probably spend less on anti-aging products if you’re taking care of your skin now. my mom had the same sudden onset of skin problems when she turned 20 like me and because she learned how to take care of her skin then, her skin now is better than any other 50 some year olds. she doesnt even wear makeup and she glows',\n",

This product is easy to apply and my face reacts better to this than it did to the newer products Clinique has put out since the beginning of the year. I use it in conjunction with the pore serum. These 2 together keeps my face looking great, smooth, less breakouts and all around same skin tone. The redness is gone as well. It is well worth the purchase. I am on my third bottle, but I also put it on my neck and face morning and evening.',\n",
       " 'I was overall very disappointed with this product. It feels almost slimy and never really absorbs into my skin. I have an oily T-zone, so this didn’t help matters. I was hoping that some of the renewing qualities would help get rid of some of the redness I experience, but wish that I’d spent the money on a trip to my dermatologist instead.',\n",

I tried this product out on a whim and within days my complexion definitely seemed brighter and my tone was much more even. I have some acne scars left over from when I was a teen and even those have diminished. Plus, the serum feels really nice when applying it. It makes my skin feel really soft and smooth.',\n",
       " 'Being a product junkie, I stopped buying this to try other products and totally wasted a huge chunk of change on various products that made promises they didn’t keep. Turnaround does all it says and more. My complexion looks brighter, smoother and, yes, radiant when I use this product. Use it under your moisturizer morning and night. It even seems to give an added moisture boost too. I will stay true and never cheat on my Turnaround again!!',\n",
       " 'I had done some research online, so I knew that I wanted to buy either the serum or a night cream for my skin. One of the Sephora employees recommended the serum so I purchased it. It is AMAZING. I have noticed a huge difference in my skin. It is softer, smoother, and more even toned. I am very impressed, and will happily continue to purchase this product.',\n",

       " 'I had been using Estee Lauder’s Idealist for quite awhile (which was very average) when I was given a little sample of this serum to try out. Within a few days I saw brightening results. My skin felt more vibrant and smoother. Over time it also help fade my discoloration. The overall effects of this serum is more subtle, but the BEST thing about it is that there were never periods of backtracking – my skin felt and became better and better over time. Perhaps it was partly because THE SERUM REALLY HELPED CLEAR MY SKIN, and I was barely getting any new scars from blemishes and blackheads since I started using this. I am on to new things now, but I would definitely repurchase in the future.',\n",
       " 'I have tried a couple serums to improve radiance and skin tone. This is so far the only one that has produced noticeable results for my face!I just finished a bottle of Caudalie Vinoperfect Radiance serum which is very highly rated and recommended by Sephora employees. However this did not give me any results. So if you tried that, now try this.This serum has completely cleared up a stubborn problem I have been fighting. My face ’broke out’ in dry, bumpy patches that would get really red and ugly. Using this serum in the day time (under lotion) and the Turnaround Night cream before bed has ELIMINATED these patches in mere days!! I’m so happy since I have been dealing with them for months!

I can’t say enough good things about this product. It is luscious and silky when applied, and my skin feels deeply hydrated and even dewy (not a word I use often) after. Sometimes I use a moisturizer, but usually don’t need to. The Clinique Turnaround Radiance is incredibly moisturizing. My skin has improved 100 percent since I changed my skincare regime and especially since I added Clinique Turnaround Radiance to the cocktail. I recommend this product for those of us over 54 and I’m sure it would be just as good for any age. Two thumbs up.',\n",

After the first week of use, my skin felt noticeably softer and smoother, and now after a month all the tiny little adult acne I’ve had on my forehead for years is greatly diminished. I think that the acne products I used in the past were too harsh and just further irritated my skin, and even though this isn’t marketed as an acne product, it helps to speed up your cell turnover which in my case seems to be keeping my pores clear. Definitely recommend this as a gentle yet effective exfoliating serum.',\n",

I have an excellent skin care regime, however, I was look for a serum to help fight first signs of aging and correct everything from pore size, to clarity, ect.Within the first week my pores were reduced, my skin was smoother, clearer and my moisturizer felt more moisturizing.I am extremely satisfied with the results after 0NE YEAR of use!!! My skin has become tighter slightly, incrediably smoother, clear and luminous! However, you must follow a real skin care regime (cleanse, tone and moisturize morning and night and protect your face with SPF when required) in order to achieve healthy looking skin. You only need less then one pump and you smooth a little all over your face and then wait a minute before you apply moisturizer.Please note that with any product you must use it properly in conjunction with an appropriate skin care regimen. Also, as with all cosmetics you must allow for one month to three to see extreme visible results. Some people experience results fatser then others.I have found my Anti-Aging serum for life thanks Clinique its awesome...magic in a bottle!!!',\n",

It gently exfoliates, makes my skin glow with radiance, treats and prevents my acne, makes spots and scars disappear, and evens my skin tone!

I have combination skin that gets very dry in the winter and prone to breakouts, but when I’m using this my skin is always clear and well hydrated. My only wish is that it came in a bigger size because it seems to run out so quickly, I have to limit myself to using it in the morning only.',\n",
       " 'I used this serum along with the turnaround overnight moisturizer and MAN, this stuff has been like bootcamp for my face. I have combination/oily skin and have the occasional breakouts, and normally wouldn’t have chosen this type of treatment for my skin. The texture of this really is silky, it almost feels like some primers because of the “slip factor“ it has. While I initially felt like that just made my face greasy, it ended up helping my moisturizer go on smoother and I didn’t have to use as much of it. The slippery feeling stays for a few minutes, so it’s best to apply this (along with a moisturizer) pretty quickly after washing your face, but it will sink it pretty completely. I use a quick toner mist like the Caudalie beauty elixir to cut down that absorption time if I’m in a rush to put my makeup on and it seems to work the same. Now, since I’ve been using both the turnaround serum and moisturizer, I’m not sure which product to attribute my TOTALLY clear skin to, but I honestly have a more even complexion and noticeably smaller pores around my nose - something I’ve always thought was impossible and thus just a marketing hoax. The best part about all this, is that it’s been one long, gradual improvement. Once my skin started clearing up I got very few, if any, new breakouts and the dark spots from the old ones quickly faded. I never thought I’d be gushing about this, but my skin is just so uniform! The turnaround system really got me in line.',\n",

Also, at 40 dollars for one ounce it’s not a bargain. Dropping 80 for baby facial that works next time. This goes on super easy and spreads easily so I like that. Maybe, this is better for sensitive skin. I felt not a bit of a tingling with this either. I know that doesn’t mean it’s not working but, still it just felt and seemed completely void of active ingredients.',\n",

It rinses easily (I used a Makeup Eraser and gently warm water). I thought I would be red after but I was not at all! My skin was instantly brighter, more even toned and radiant, and silky smooth. I am so excited to use it again in a week’s time. Fair price point for how little you need and how seldom you need to use it. I did not expect to like it, but I really, really did. Well played, Paula’s Choice. Well played.',\n",

My dry patches are usually taken care of after I use the mask (even with my sensitive skin I can handle the full ten minutes without irritation), but I have some texture on my cheeks which has persisted.HOWEVER, this is the first product I have tried that has really drastically lightened the stubborn dark spots left behind by acne; which for me usually linger for at least a month.

My skin does look brighter as well. The product is a super pretty color and made me feel special just from smoothing it on my face. The product itself is a very pretty purple color and has a slimy feeling (in a good way if that makes sense). Aside from those points, the rest are sadly negatives. I don’t notice a difference in my pores. My face is a little red because I just got out of the shower but I will attach before and after pictures. Another negative, the smell. It’s pretty odd. At first when I started smoothing it over my skin it smelled like feet to me. Which is obviously a big turn off, especially with rubbing it on my face. I tried to get past the smell and tried to think of something else. The scent did slightly remind me of raw cocoa powder but still, I couldn’t get the smell of feet off my mind. However, the smell was only around for a minute and definitely didn’t linger. It was only during the initial application that I even noticed it. Overall, this was my first time trying a peel like this and I am slightly disappointed to be honest. I’m glad that my skin texture and complexion slightly improved but aside from that, I’m not sure that this product is worth it to me. I will try it again of course and hopefully my next experience isn’t as lackluster as this one.',\n",

I applied the Skin Perfecting 25% AHA + 2% BHA Exfoliant Peel and left it on for exactly 10 minutes.  The product is purple, and the consistency was pretty thin, and the product went a long way, so I think a tube will last a good while. There was a tiny amount of stinging, but not enough to worry about.  As it dried, it had a shimmery look to it.  Kind of like the “unicorn“ look that is so popular these days.  After 10 minutes, I rinsed off the product, and my skin was pretty red, but within one minute, most of the redness was gone.  My skin felt less bumpy than it normally does. The texture was very much improved. I felt like every pore on my face was totally empty of impurities!  It had a very clean feeling.  Meaning, my face felt clean when touching it, and also without touching it. My skin felt firm as I smiled, or spoke, but on the flip side, my face felt so very soft to the touch. My skin did stay a little bit pink, but I could tell that there was a new brightness to it.  This peel was a breeze!  Just apply, wait 10 minutes and then rinse off.  I am a bit shocked that a 10-minute peel could offer such quick results.  I will continue to use this product in the future because if it works this well after only 10-minutes, I can only imagine the amazing results after continued use!',\n",

This is multi-acid, rinse-off exfoliant peel that dramatically resurfaces skin to visibly smooth wrinkles, refine rough, bumpy texture, brighten tone & unclog pores.This comes in a 30mL squeeze tube. The directions say to use this once a week. Apply a generous layer on clean skin, avoiding your immediate eye area and lips. Leave on 10 minutes, then rinse thoroughly. The solution is a pretty purple cream. That makes it easy to see where you have applied it. It does have a slightly fragrance but it isn’t overpowering. I didn’t experience any skin sensitivity at all after using this. Since it contains AHA you will need to wear sunscreen after using. After using this peel, my skin looked radiant and glowing. My fine lines looked smoother and my entire skin texture actually looks smoother. I definitely am going to keep using this and I recommend it.',\n",

It was my first time trying the 25% AHA + 2% BHA Exfoliant Peel and I was a bit cautious because I have sensitive combination skin and didn’t know how my skin would react. I applied this at my night time routine after cleansing my face, left it on for 10 minutes and then I rinsed it off. As a first impression, there’s no particular smell to this product, if you are familiar with the PC products then you’ll recognize it and I felt a slight tingling on my cheeks, but when I rinsed the product off, there was no redness or any sign of irritation. My skin felt really, really soft and radiant. I want to play with this product more so I can form a more conclusive opinion, but I was quite pleased seeing how well this product works after a first use. Don’t forget to apply SPF after using this product! I always do!',\n",

I still have some acne and hyperpigmentation too. I’ve tried many wash off peels, masks and treatments from a great many brands and there is just something very satisfying about using this peel off. So long as you apply a good layer it’ll peel off easily without trouble. I usually use this after a shower and keep on for recommend time. I have the smoothest and most radiant skin after this peel.

I’m sure if I use the cream longer, I might be able to see more of a difference.  It does help with dead skin, which happens a lot for me during the winter months. As for fine lines and wrinkles, I have to use the product for a longer period of time. I followed the directions; use on clean skin, leave on skin for 10 minutes and rinse with warm water and pat dry. The product did dry fast on my skin while I was applying and was sticky to the touch when I accidentally applied to an area I had already applied too.  I did experience a slight tingling for the first minute after applying the product. It wasn’t a discomfort and the tingling went away quickly. This is described on the packaging that it may occur. Overall, I would continue to use the product once a week to exfoliate my face and neck.',\n",

I followed instructions as is and after ten minutes on skin I felt a big difference. My skin felt clean,smooth and did a good job brightening my skin. My complexion was better and had a subtle glow but I did notice that my face felt tight and a little dry afterwards.

I don’t have any “major“ skin issues but as I get a little older I AM noticing more little fine lines and my skin generally isn’t as smooth as I would like it to be so I was hoping that using this solution would improve the overall texture of my skin.  Unfortunately I’m a little disappointed because I really can’t see any noticeable results that this gives me.  Granted, I tend to have somewhat resilient--and not at all sensitive--skin and while this may work better for someone who needs a gentle approach to acids, this may not be quite enough for a more adventurous user.  That’s not to say that it’s a bad product; it just wasn’t a good fit for me.  On the plus side, I haven’t seen any actual negative effects from it but I really haven’t seen any positive ones, either.',\n",

This almost felt as if I was putting a cleanser onto my face just without the lather as it stayed on like an absorbent layer. The second pic I already rinsed off the peel after just 10 minutes and I noticed first the glow. Secondly I had realized how smooth my skin looked and much more brighter and calmed. The redness I had seemed to have dissapeared a lot and the texture of my skin felt smooth and not dry and patchy anymore. Pore wise some bumps had decreased that were on my cheek and turned dark and small. Overall my first impression is I really like this peel and will be using it every other week since i loved the fast results.

I used my finger to apply this product and it was easy to apply won’t lie and the instructions say leave it on for 10 mins. I did and I must say it didn’t tingle, burn or leave my skin red. Kinda made me wonder if it worked but right after removing this my skin had this glow to it. I wish I had taken a picture for the first time I used this because I definitely saw a difference then. For products like this I really think 1 try isn’t good enough so I did try a few times. My skin did show improvements and felt very soft along with having a natural glow.

For the amount you have to use vs the price and size of the tube, this product would barely last a month, maybe 2.When initially put on the skin I did not experience any stinging like I do with other AHA/BHA peeling solutions.  It is a beautiful color and easy to spread. I applied after a double cleanse to ensure my skin was squeaky clean and rinsed off after 10 minutes.  It was fairly easy to wash off and my skin did not feel irritated or sensitive. However, I did not notice any difference in my skin.

My skin feels so incredibly soft and supple after us. It’s also quite radiant. Over the past week I’ve noticed an improvement in my pores. Specially since I was out of my other product for a couple days and my skin was looking pretty rough.  My pores are less clogged with continued use and appear smaller. Didn’t have any reactions.

I can’t wait to see the long term effects of this.  This was gifted by Paula’s Choice.',\n",
       " 'I was gifted by Paula’s choice skin perfecting 25% AHA + 2% BHA exfoliant peel and I really liked it.The texture of the peel went on very smoothly and had a purple iridescent color to it.My skin felt wonderful after I washed the peel off.My pores were smaller,my skin was softer,brighter and helped with my lines close to my eye area and my acne.I would definitely recommend this product.',\n",
       " 'This is gifted by Paula’s choice and I am loving it. Tried it tonight, within ten minutes my redness was gone and my face was smooth. It doesn’t stick or stick, and is easy to wash off. Overall it made my face dewy and hydrated. If you have not tried this product yet, your missing out.',\n",
       " 'Amazing peel off, after trying the product for the first time left my skin super soft and not feeling dry at all,love it',\n",
       " 'I received this product complimentary from paula’s choice in exchange for a review. I love the way this makes my skin feel after i rinse it off.The consistency is decent and applies on perfectly and easily. My skin looks more radiant and is very smooth. I’m excited to use it Again next week.',\n",
       " 'I received this complimentary from Paula’s Choice product.  25% AHA + 2%BHA exfoliating peel.  After the first use it has made my skin very soft and has diminished the look of my pores. I was afraid it was going to be harsh, but I didn’t have any adverse side effects. I would recommend this product to my friends.',\n",
       " 'This was gifted by Paula’s Choice. This peel is amazing! I was a little worried to use it because I don’t have experience with peels, but it was easy to use and rinse off and it didn’t irritate my skin. My skin did get a little bit pinker after using it but that went away in the morning. I used it at night and followed with a moisturizer and it made my skin look great afterwards! It was glowing, brighter and my texture looked smoother. Not to mention my skin felt really soft and smooth. I definitely going to be using this once a week from now on!',\n",
       " 'Complimentary from Paula’s choice for my honest review. I was surprised by how small the bottle was, but it only takes a little bit to get the job done. Initially there was some stingy in areas but not that bad. Not enough to make me instantly wash it off. My face and neck did look better after the first use. Will continue to use it and see if more improvements appear',\n",
       " 'Complimentary from Paula’s Choice. This is a great effective yet gentle exfoliating mask! It’s so easy to put on and easy to wash off. It doesn’t sting my skin and doesn’t leave me red. When I wash it off, I’m left with smooth, soft, and glowy skin.',\n",
       " 'I received this complimentary from Paula’s Choice for my honest review. I’ve used this once so far and got great results. This definitely left my skin really soft and radiant. I used as directed by leaving it on for 10 mins before rinsing it off. Feels safe enough to use it more than once a week but, I’ll stick to the recommended use. Can’t wait to use it again next week because it makes my skin feel wonderful!',\n",
       " 'Paula’s Choice gifted me this product. I love chemical exfoliators because they seem more effective than physical ones, I enjoy the pads because I don’t need to rinse them. But I was curious to try this one. It’s like a mask you normally apply, leave it for a few minutes and then rinse. It stung a little but it was for a while, then it subsided. My face looked and felt smoother after that but I think it’s very strong so I will use it once a week instead of twice wich is what I am accustomed.',\n",
       " 'I absolutely love this product. I was gifted by Paula’s Choice the 25% AHA + 2% BHA Exfoliant Peel. I’ve only used this once but after I used this I immediately felt like my skin was hydrated and glowing!',\n",
       " 'I received this peel complimentary from Paula’s Choice. For reference, I have dry skin. This peel is super easy to use. I use it once a week after cleansing at night. If you use it in the AM remember to use a sunsreen. Just apply a generous amount and leave it on for about 10 minutes. After you wash it off your skin feels so smooth and has this brightness to it without drying out your skin. I’ve used other peels out there, but for the money, this is a home run. I would definitely recommend this product.',\n",
       " 'I have dry skin with some aging lines.  I love how it made my skin feel.  It was super soft.  It definitely hydrated my skin.  I was very happy with the resultsI received this exfoliant peel complimentary from paula’s choice',\n",

Complimentary from Paula’s Choice',\n",
       " 'I received this exfoliant peel complimentary from paula’s choice. For reference I have combo skin and suffer from texture and enlarged pores.this peel is super easy to use. I use it once a week after cleansing. Just apply a generous amount and leave it on for about 15 minutes. After you wash it off your skin feels so smooth and has this brightness to it. My skin didn’t feel dried out either. It does have a slight tingle but that is to be expected when using aha/bha. On the nights I use this peel I don’t apply any retinols. Just a basic moisturizer and I have no irritations. Definitely going to continue using this once a week.',\n",
       " 'I love a peel, especially on areas that tend to have more issues like my forehead or around my nose/cheeks. This is gentle but mighty in power and leaves my skin soft and clear. Gifted by paulas choice.',\n",
       " 'I love Paula Choice, and so excited it is finally available on Sephora! So convenient. The leek is great. I have some aging signs, and the peel works great to reduce the lines, smooth the skin. Very easy to apply, and great results are right away. Definitely recommend to try if you have similar issues. I use it along with other Oaulas Vjoice products as well. This peel I received complimentary from Paula’s Choice, but the review is my very own.',\n",
       " 'I received this 25% AHA + 2% BHA Exfoliant Peel complimentary from Paula’s Choice. Wow, what an amazing peel! I use this one a week to help exfoliate my skin. It leaves it incredibly smooth and soft. I’d highly recommend it!',\n",
       " 'Nice and light on the face. Does have a light scent which does not bother me. Doesn’t feel like another layer of make up added to your face which is what I was looking for!',\n",
       " 'Has carcinogenic ingredients. It has a really sheltering smell which I could taste for hours after applying. Only thing about it I love is how it doesn’t get clogged when sprayed.',\n",
       " 'It is sooooo scented its crazy, feels like im putting perfume on! Its also greasy, overall i wish those two things were differently because i love how easy it is to just spray it on (it is clear).',\n",
       " 'Horrible protection! Applied as directed and got a horrible burn on vacation in Brazil.',\n",
       " 'So easy to use and light, makes me actually reapply sunscreen which is huge, truly a luxe experience.',\n",
       " 'I liked the thought of this.  In theory.  Especially for my shoulders, behind my neck as i like to wear a lot of off the shoulder tops and rompers.  However, the mister is a little weird and you end up having to rub it in.  Which was ok.  What was a little annoying was that it felt a little greasy.  As a spray formula, I’m not sure if that would be normal??? As I have only ever used squeezy tube sunscreen.  All in all, I think it does offer protection and I do like the thought of it being on an easy to go packaging for the back / shoulder / neck / chest area as well.  I just wasn’t a fan of how oily it felt after it set / was rubbed in.  If not for the oiliness, it would have definitely been five stars!',\n",
       " 'I’m confused by the less than perfect reviews. This SPF is the best spray I’ve found by far. It gives a nice glow without leaving an oily or sticky residue. I’ve sprayed it on my face even… and no breakout! It’s a high SPF in a generous quantity … Absolutely nothing to complain about here. It’s my favorite item for the Summer!',\n",
       " 'This is a great brand but this spray on SPF, is not their greatest product. It does protect well but sprays on very VERY oily. It also has alcohol in it which is extremely painful if you get in your eyes. Which, as it turns out, is unavoidable as it layers into your eyelashes and eventually makes its way into your eyes. If you have contacts, this is even more painful. Overall it’s not good if you have sensitive skin or rosacea.',\n",
       " 'I was hoping that for the price the product would last longer. It works really well and leaves my skin feeling nice. It’s pretty to run off, so the areas next to swim suits and clothing may need to be replenished more quickly.',\n",
       " 'Bought this for an Italy trip I had to reapply sunscreen to my face. It has a light kind of clean scent to it, and does make your skin a little oily looking, but looks totally fine after you gently pat it into your face. Love it!',\n",
       " 'I love this spray, gives a glow as well. Easy to apply, the spray nozzle doesn’t leak and it lasts quite a while. The only sunscreen I use except for Elta MD.',\n",
       " 'Really wanted to like this but the chemical smell is so overwhelming and lingered even after I swam. Tried it three times then returned it. Quite a disappointment.',\n",
       " 'it is not good for beach. i am big fan for  Shiseido but i do not like this product',\n",
       " 'PROS : It’s water-like, so I feel light on my skin. Completely dry after an hour. After the first hour, you only feel your own skin, no greasy feeling at all. (First hour isn’t bad at all, just a little moist)CONS : 1. Shine: When you just apply it on, your skin looks a little shine for an hour. 2. Alcohol included.You can definitely smell it. I have no problem with alcohol, but those of you who have sensitive skin need to be aware.3. The packaging is a big NO NO to me. You have to be super careful when spaying it on, must avoid your eye area because it stung my eye for the whole day. When it comes to the eye area, you should spray it on your palm, then use a finger to tap it on around your eye area.',\n",
       " 'This use to be my favorite Sunscreen Spray until I learned that it Stains. When it stains it doesn’t come off either. But other than that it’s  a good product.',\n",
       " 'Horrible packaging - leaked everywhere and I lost a majority of this expensive product that way. Also pretty greasy. But I guess it does work which is why I’m leaving 2 stars. Pretty disappointed with this purchase.',\n",
       " 'I have used this for over 2 years in the Texas sun without any sunburns, acne breakouts, or skin damage. I ordered a new bottle and within two times wearing it, I have noticed that it has had no sun protection whatsoever. I’m not sure what they have done to change the formula or if storage was an issue, but I will be returning it and hopefully finding an effective replacement.',\n",
       " 'This has an extremely strong alcohol smell. I wasnt comfortable enough to even put it on my face based on the smell alone. I will be returning it.',\n",
       " 'I’ve used this product for years.  The last bottle I purchased has a strong smell, and does nothing to protect from the sun.  I’ve been using it, but I have a tan.',\n",
       " 'I have sensitive skin and some of the sunscreens out there (the really thick pasty types) really mess with my skin. This sunscreen is the best I have ever used. It’s light and not greasy or sticky. Coverage is great, I burn very easily and this protects my skin very well.',\n",
       " 'My husband uses this and loves it. He uses it on his body when it’s sunny outside. We have bought it multiple times.',\n",
       " 'Left my skin oily and the smell is really, really strong.',\n",
       " 'I love this sunscreen. I’ve gone through 2 bottles since last summer. I’m giving it 4 stars because maybe there is something better out there but this works really well for me. I keep it in a 3 oz spray bottle for traveling and carry it with me everywhere. My main suggestion is don’t spray it directly on your face but into your hands and then pat onto your face. If you get it into your eyes it can burn. Other than that it’s great!',\n",
       " 'The best sunscreen. Spray it on your face no problem just keep your eyes and mouth shut and dab the corners of your eyes with a towel or cotton to make sure it doesn’t get in. I have not even gotten the slightest tan while wearing this and definitely no burn. I’m super pale so this is the first product that has been easy to apply that actually fully protected my skin from the sun!',\n",
       " 'I am okay with its formula, I just don’t like that the sprayer leaks and the spray comes out too wide, it leaves a pile of greasy sunscreen on your floor after using it. Very slippery.',\n",

       " nan,\n",
       " 'This burned my face every time I put on my face. I spray on my hands then apply on face. It gave me the burning feeling, red & itchy patches all over my face, after few days my skin was so dry and peel off which made my skin more irritated. I didn’t have any problem with my body skin and I have never had any skin allergy to sunscreen products before. I bought this in store and my purpose to choose this was to reapply sunscreen on top of make-up.I was recommended to stop using my normal skincare products by doctor. Now, I’m treating my skin with “1% hydrocortisone” beside with Celtaphil cleanser and moisturizer.',\n",
       " 'Burns a little bit when applying however it works really well. Perfect since i can wear it with my makeup on and spray every 2 hours throughout the day!',\n",
       " 'I had such high hopes for this product. I have combination skin (oily t-zone / dry everywhere else). The directions state to “apply liberally 15 minutes before sun exposure.“ I did maybe 4-5 sprays and waited. For the first 30 minutes it looked like I had taken cooking oil, put it in a spray bottle, and used it all over my face. It has now been a couple hours since I first applied the spray and the shine isn’t as bad as the first 30 minutes, however, my face is still considerably shiny and it looks and feels like I’m wearing actual OIL. There’s no other way to describe this feeling honestly. I saw a bunch of people say that it works great as a setting spray? It does not (or at least it did not for me). Even after 2-3 hours, it looks and feels like? You guessed it: OIL.I still wanted to give it a chance so I sprayed it on my legs and arms as well to see if it works sans makeup? It absolutely, truly does not. So now I look like I took a dip in a pool filled with oil instead of water.If you don’t want to look like a glazed Krispy Kreme Donut, I suggest you don’t buy this.',\n",
       " 'lightly oily but it does absorb. the real problem is the fragrance. it lingers for hours and it’s a bit chemically smelling. doesn’t seem to get icky in your hair, if that’s what you’re into.',\n",

       " 'I really liked that it wouldn’t ruin my makeup when I used it and I liked that the formulation was a spray. The only thing I didn’t like was it would make my skin greasy and shiny after a few hours and I didn’t like how that felt on my skin. My skin is already oily when I’m out in the hot sun so it’s just a minor flaw to me. I like that it’s over 50 SPF.',\n",

Seriously, for 10+ years, I struggled with acne. Now, I do not recognize my skin. It’s just been so amazing for me, plus I cannot live without the deliciously intoxicating smell of this oil. I bought some for my sister as well, and her skin looks great too. THANK YOU! <3\n",
